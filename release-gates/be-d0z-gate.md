# Release gate — be-d0z (CountIssues / CountIssuesGroupedBy)

- **Bead:** be-d0z (review bead for build be-nu4.1.1 / ADR be-nu4 §4.D1)
- **Commit shipped:** `b84ebda0` — cherry-pick of `c80bdfe0` (builder branch `gc-builder-e35c0415a93c`)
- **Branch:** `release/be-d0z` (stacks on `release/be-nu4.3-stack` — PR #3458 — which stacks on `release/be-eqw` — PR #3453)
- **Evaluated:** 2026-04-24 by beads/deployer

## Scope note

The D1 commit's interface additions (`CountIssues`,
`CountIssuesGroupedBy` on `storage.Storage`) are positioned in
`internal/storage/storage.go` immediately after `SearchIssueSummaries`.
That places a positional dependency on D3 being already applied in the
cherry-pick base — not a semantic dependency (the Count methods don't
call into `SearchIssueSummaries`), just where the diff's context lines
need to land. A cherry-pick onto `release/be-eqw` (D2 only) fails with
a storage.go context conflict; onto `release/be-nu4.3-stack` (D2+D3)
it applies cleanly.

Choice: stack this PR on #3458. Merge ordering: #3453 → #3458 →
this PR. Each of the three has independently passing gate criteria;
this PR carries only the D1 diff on top of #3458's HEAD.

## Gate criteria

| # | Criterion | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Review PASS present | **PASS** | First-pass review verdict `PASS` recorded in be-d0z notes on commit `c80bdfe0`. Gemini second-pass currently disabled per project policy. |
| 2 | Acceptance criteria met | **PASS** | Filter-parity at 1K rows across every `IssueFilter` dimension (16 subtests) — PASS per reviewer. Grouped-by parity across `status / priority / issue_type / assignee / label` × 3 filters (15 subtests) — PASS. Allowlist-rejects with named-field error (6 subtests) — PASS. Wisp-admission mirrors `SearchIssuesInTx` (Ephemeral=true/nil/false). Label grouping two-phase via `GetLabelsForIssuesInTx` with the D2 wisp set. `renderGroupKeys` preserves count sums on display-string collisions; byte-for-byte display parity with pre-D1 `bd count` output retained. `BenchmarkCountIssues_1K` 1.83ms / `BenchmarkCountIssuesGroupedBy_status_1K` 4.36ms — well inside FR-1 (≤250ms at 49K) and FR-2 (≤500ms at 49K). |
| 3 | Tests pass | **PASS** | See "Tests run on release branch" below. |
| 4 | No high-severity review findings open | **PASS** | 0 HIGH findings. Reviewer's note called out three `fmt.Sprintf` sites in `countTableInTx`, `groupByColumnSingleTableInTx`, `filteredIDsInTx` and verified they conform to the "tables hardcoded, columns from allowlist, args via `?`" contract — no new injection surface. |
| 5 | Final branch is clean | **PASS** | `git status` on `release/be-d0z` shows nothing except worktree-scaffolding untracked paths (`.gc/`, `.gitkeep`) that are never staged. |
| 6 | Branch diverges cleanly from main | **PASS (stacked)** | Triple stack: `release/be-eqw` (D2, #3453) → `release/be-nu4.3-stack` (D3, #3458) → `release/be-d0z` (D1, this PR). D1 cherry-pick applied to the D3 head with zero conflicts. Once #3453 and #3458 land on `origin/main`, this branch becomes a clean diff against main. |

## Tests run on release branch

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `go build ./...` | PASS | Go 1.26.2 via `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`. |
| `go vet ./...` | clean | No output. |
| `TestCountReferences / TestCountExistingIssues_* / TestCountMetadataKeys` (cmd/bd, non-container) | PASS 0.795s | No regression from the `type` → `issue_type` internal rename. |
| `TestCountIssues_FilterParity` (dolt, container-dependent) | PASS all 16 subtests | Per reviewer's 24.25s run with `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true`. Deployer did not re-run container tests; relying on reviewer PASS at commit `c80bdfe0`. |
| `TestCountIssuesGroupedBy_Parity` | PASS all 15 subtests | Per reviewer's 25.04s run. |
| `TestCountIssuesGroupedBy_AllowlistRejects` | PASS all 6 subtests | Error message names every valid field value. |

## Out of scope (per bead, intentionally deferred)

- Caching / materialized views / denormalized counters (ADR §11.5,
  tracked as D5 follow-up be-nu4.5).
- `SearchIssues` changes (D3 ships the summary projection; D1 is
  count aggregation only).
- Flag or output-format changes on `bd count` (ADR §11.3).

## Verdict

**PASS** — commit gate markdown to `release/be-d0z`; push to `fork`
(origin is locked for quad341 per `release/be-eqw` / #3453 precedent);
open PR against `gastownhall/beads:main`, stacking on #3458.

---

## Round 2 — be-9t7 feedback addressed

- **Trigger:** PR #3461 received `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from @coffeegoddd
  on 2026-05-07 with three asks: push the optimization to issueops,
  add a benchmark beating the prior SQL, strip app-layer special-casing.
- **Source bead:** be-9t7 (closed) — builder work on this round.
- **Review bead:** be-21rb — reviewer recorded `PASS` on commit
  `f33b4fbd1` at 2026-05-12T03:50Z.
- **HEAD evaluated:** `f33b4fbd1` (release/be-d0z), already pushed to
  `fork/release/be-d0z`, matches the PR #3461 head OID.
- **Commits since round 1:**
  - `83a94f5a4` — `fix(cmd): move sanitizeDBName out of cgo-only file`
    (unblocks `CGO_ENABLED=0` build; cross-cuts be-pp0).
  - `f33b4fbd1` — `test(bench): add CountIssues vs SearchIssues
    comparison benchmarks (be-9t7)` — the benchmark @coffeegoddd asked
    for.

### Gate criteria — round 2

| # | Criterion | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Review PASS present | **PASS** | be-21rb notes record `Review verdict: PASS` on `f33b4fbd1`. Reviewer walked all three @coffeegoddd asks and confirmed each addressed: issueops layer (`internal/storage/issueops/count.go`, 296 LOC), benchmark (`internal/storage/dolt/dolt_benchmark_test.go` — 1K speedups 13.6× / 11.3× / 3.5×), app-layer special-casing stripped from `cmd/bd/count.go`. Gemini second-pass disabled per project policy. |
| 2 | Acceptance criteria met | **PASS** | All three reviewer asks addressed (see above). Original D1 acceptance (filter-parity, grouped-by parity, allowlist rejects, wisp admission, byte-for-byte CLI parity) re-validated by reviewer against `f33b4fbd1`. |
| 3 | Tests pass | **PASS** | Deployer re-ran on `f33b4fbd1`: `go build ./...` clean; `go vet ./...` clean; `go test ./internal/storage/issueops/` PASS (0.005s); `go test ./cmd/bd/ -run 'TestCount(Reference\|MetadataKeys\|ExistingIssues_Worktree(Fallback\|LocalBeadsPreferred))'` PASS (0.263s); `go test -run '^$' ./internal/storage/dolt/` confirms the benchmark file compiles (Dolt container tests gated on Docker, skipped in this env; reviewer ran the container-dependent parity suites and recorded PASS). |
| 4 | No high-severity review findings open | **PASS** | be-21rb lists zero HIGH findings. Two taste-level minors (two-snapshot read inconsistency in `cmd/bd/count.go` groupBy path; local `itoa` to avoid `strconv` import) explicitly called non-blocking by reviewer. |
| 5 | Final branch is clean | **PASS** | `git status` on `release/be-d0z` shows only worktree-scaffolding untracked paths (`.gc/`, `.gitkeep`) that are never staged. |
| 6 | Branch diverges cleanly from main | **PASS (stacked)** | Same stack structure as round 1: `release/be-eqw` (#3453) → `release/be-nu4.3-stack` (#3458) → `release/be-d0z` (this PR). GitHub reports `CONFLICTING` against `main` because #3453/#3458 are still open; once they merge this becomes a clean diff. No new conflicts introduced by round-2 commits. |

### Pre-existing failures (not introduced)

- `cmd/bd/doctor/fix/TestFixMissingMetadata_DoltRepair` — `bd_version`
  drift (0.48 vs 0.49.6); pre-dates this PR.
- `cmd/bd/TestCountExistingIssues_WorktreeNoBeadsAnywhere` — fails on
  hosts with `~/.beads/` because `FindBeadsDir()` falls back to it
  (introduced 2026-04-08 by Osamu Okano, commit `614d925868`).

### Verdict — round 2

**PASS** — branch is already on `fork/release/be-d0z` at `f33b4fbd1`,
matching the PR head. Commit this gate addendum, push the new commit
to `fork/release/be-d0z` so the PR picks it up, then hand the bead
back closed. Stays stacked on #3458; nothing to open or re-open.
