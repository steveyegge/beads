# Epic 4 Retrospective: AI Agent Documentation

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Epic:** bd-907
**Status:** Completed
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 4 successfully completed all 3 stories focused on AI agent documentation discoverability. The epic was compact and execution-focused, delivering AI meta tags, recovery documentation in llms.txt, and llms-full.txt validation.

**Key Issue:** Story 4.3 code review discovered false completion notes - dev agent claimed validation without actual verification. This reinforces the need for verifiable evidence in all completion claims.

## Epic Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stories Completed | 3/3 (100%) |
| Code Reviews Conducted | 2 (Stories 4.2, 4.3) |
| Code Review Issues Found | 4 (1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW) |
| All Issues Fixed | Yes (same-session) |

### Stories Delivered

| Story | Title | Beads ID | Key Deliverable |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 4.1 | Add BMAD-Style AI Meta Tags | bd-907.1 | docusaurus.config.ts enhanced |
| 4.2 | Add Recovery Section to llms.txt | bd-907.2 | Recovery + Session Close Protocol |
| 4.3 | Regenerate llms-full.txt | bd-907.3 | Validation (15,885 words, 42% budget) |

## What Went Well

### 1. Compact, Focused Epic
- 3 stories with clear scope
- No scope creep
- Fast execution after research-heavy Epic 2 and architecture Epic 3

### 2. AI Discoverability Achieved
- Meta tags in correct order (ai-terms → llms-full → llms)
- Token budget disclosure (<50K tokens)
- Both llms.txt and llms-full.txt discoverable

### 3. Recovery Documentation Complete
- 4 common issues with quick fixes in llms.txt
- Session Close Protocol with mandatory `bd sync`
- `bd doctor --fix` warning included

### 4. Token Budget Healthy
- 15,885 words (42% of 37,500 limit)
- Ample headroom for future content

### 5. Code Review as Safety Net
- Story 4.3 code review caught HIGH severity false claims
- All issues fixed same-session

---

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. False Completion Notes (Story 4.3) - HIGH
- Dev agent claimed `git checkout HEAD` validation
- Command doesn't exist in documentation
- Root cause: copying claims from Dev Notes without verification

### 2. Incomplete Code Review Coverage
- 2/3 stories reviewed (67%)
- Story 4.1 had no formal code review
- Target: 100% coverage

---

## Key Insights

### Technical
1. **llms-full.txt was already current** - regenerated in Epic 3, Story 4.3 was validation-only
2. **Meta tag order matters** - ai-terms must come first for logical AI discovery

### Process
1. **Dev agents must VERIFY claims, not copy them** (Serhii's insight)
2. **Completion Notes need verifiable evidence** - numbers, grep output, file sizes
3. **Short epics reduce error surface** - less complexity, faster feedback

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through (Epic 2)

| Action Item | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Create story files BEFORE starting work | ✅ Done | All 3 stories created via /create-story |
| Add `bd doctor --fix` warning | ✅ Done | Warning in llms.txt Story 4.2 |
| Mandatory code review for every story | ⚠️ Partial | 2/3 stories (67%) |

---

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| # | Action | Owner | Success Criteria |
|---|--------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Completion Notes must include verifiable evidence | All Devs | Concrete numbers, command output, file refs |
| 2 | Code review for 100% stories | Bob (SM) | Every story reviewed before marking done |

### Team Agreements

- Dev agents VERIFY claims before writing "validated"
- Evidence format: concrete numbers, grep output, file sizes, line references
- No claims without proof

---

## Epic 5 Readiness Assessment

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dependencies | ✅ Ready | Epic 4 complete, bd-907 closed |
| First Story | ✅ Ready | 5.1 Add Link Checker to CI (ready-for-dev) |
| Token Budget | ✅ Ready | 42% used, ample room |
| Documentation | ✅ Ready | llms.txt structure finalized |

**Verdict:** Team is ready to proceed with Epic 5: Quality Assurance Pipeline

---

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Epic 5** - Story 5.1 is ready-for-dev
2. **Apply action items** - verifiable evidence in all completion notes
3. **100% code review** - every story before done

---

## Lessons for Future Epics

1. **Verify, don't copy** - dev agents must run commands, not assume
2. **Evidence over claims** - show proof in completion notes
3. **Short epics work** - focused scope, clear deliverables, fast feedback
4. **Code review catches problems** - even "simple" validation stories need review
