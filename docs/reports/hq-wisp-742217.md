## Summary

Executed beads-upstream-sync workflow to sync steveyegge/beads upstream into groblegark/beads fork, build, and install.

## Findings

### Repository Status
- **Location**: /home/ubuntu/groblegark-beads
- **Origin**: https://github.com/groblegark/beads.git
- **Upstream**: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads.git

### Sync Status

- **Merge required**: No

### Build & Install
- **Build**: Successful (commit beff2556)
- **Version**: bd 0.48.0
- **Install location**: ~/.local/bin/bd
- **Verification**: bd commands working correctly

## Steps Executed

1. Verified repository location and remotes
2. Confirmed working tree clean on main branch
3. Fetched from upstream (steveyegge/beads)
4. Checked for new upstream commits (none found)
5. Built bd binary with `make build`
6. Installed to ~/.local/bin/bd
7. Verified bd version and functionality

## Notes

- The formula wisp had dependency issues (hq-wisp-412a53 not found), so steps were executed manually based on the workflow description
- groblegark fork is significantly ahead of upstream, suggesting active development in the fork

## Recommendations

None - sync completed successfully. No action required until upstream publishes new commits.
