# Shadowbook

### `bd` — detect when specs change but code doesn't know

> Specs evolve. Tasks sprint. Shadowbook catches the drift.

You edit `specs/login.md` at 3am. The issue implementing it should know. Shadowbook watches spec files for changes and flags linked issues before your code drifts from reality.

## The Problem: Spec Drift

You write a spec. You create an issue to implement it. Then you update the spec—but the issue keeps building the old version.

```bash
bd create "Implement login flow" --spec-id specs/login.md
```

Later, you edit the spec:

```diff
# specs/login.md (updated at 3am)
- "OAuth2 with Google"
+ "OAuth2 with Google AND Apple"
```

The issue `bd-a1b2` is still building Google-only auth. **The spec changed, but the code doesn't know.**

This is spec drift.

---

## The Solution: Drift Detection

Shadowbook compares spec file hashes against linked issues. When a spec changes, linked issues get flagged.

```bash
bd spec scan

● SPEC CHANGED: specs/login.md
  ↳ bd-a1b2 "Implement login flow" — spec updated, issue unaware
```

Find all drifted issues:

```bash
bd list --spec-changed
```

Acknowledge after reviewing:

```bash
bd update bd-a1b2 --ack-spec
```

**Key insight:** Specs are files. Files have hashes. When hashes change, linked issues get flagged.

---

## Context Economics: Auto-Compaction

Completed specs waste tokens. A 2000-token spec that's done should become a 20-token summary.

```bash
bd spec compact specs/login.md --summary "OAuth2 login. 3 endpoints. JWT. Done Jan 2026."
```

| Before | After | Savings |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Full spec in context | Summary in registry | **~95%** |
| ~2000 tokens | ~20 tokens | Per spec |

Shadowbook scores specs for auto-compaction using multiple factors:
- All linked issues closed (+40%)
- Spec unchanged 30+ days (+20%)
- Code unmodified 45+ days (+20%)
- Marked SUPERSEDED (+20%)

```bash
bd spec candidates        # Show compaction candidates with scores
bd spec auto-compact      # Compact specs scoring above threshold
bd close bd-xyz --compact-spec  # Compact on issue close
```

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What it means | Command |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Spec files | Markdown files defining requirements | `specs/*.md` |
| Drift | Spec changed, issue doesn't know | `bd spec scan` |
| Link | Issue tracks a spec | `bd create --spec-id` |
| Acknowledge | Mark issue as aware of spec change | `bd update --ack-spec` |
| Compact | Archive completed spec to summary | `bd spec compact` |
| Auto-compact | Score and archive stale specs | `bd spec auto-compact` |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anupamchugh/shadowbook/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# Or: go install github.com/anupamchugh/shadowbook/cmd/bd@latest

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
bd init
mkdir -p specs

# Write a spec
echo "# Login Feature" > specs/login.md

# Scan specs
bd spec scan

# Create an issue linked to the spec
bd create "Implement login" --spec-id specs/login.md

# ... spec changes ...

# Detect drift
bd spec scan
bd list --spec-changed

# Acknowledge
bd update bd-xyz --ack-spec
```

---

## How It Works

```
specs/login.md             ←── You edit the spec
       ↓
   bd spec scan            ←── Shadowbook detects SHA256 change
       ↓
   bd-a1b2                 ←── Issue flagged: SPEC CHANGED
   (spec_id: specs/login.md)
       ↓
   bd list --spec-changed  ←── Find drifted issues
       ↓
   bd update bd-a1b2 --ack-spec  ←── Acknowledge new spec
```

## Spec Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `bd spec scan` | Detect spec changes, flag linked issues |
| `bd spec list` | List all tracked specs with issue counts |
| `bd spec show <path>` | Show spec details + linked issues |
| `bd spec coverage` | Find specs with no linked issues |
| `bd spec compact <path>` | Archive spec to summary |

## Features

Everything from beads, plus:

- **Spec Registry** — SQLite cache of specs (path, title, SHA256, timestamps)
- **Drift Detection** — `bd spec scan` compares hashes, flags linked issues
- **Coverage Metrics** — Find specs with no linked issues
- **Drift Alerts** — `SPEC CHANGED` warning in issue output
- **Multi-Factor Compaction** — Score specs by staleness (closed issues, age, activity)
- **Auto-Match** — Suggest links using Jaccard similarity (`bd spec suggest`)
- **Skills Manifest** — Track skill drift across Claude/Codex agents (`specs/skills/manifest.json`)
- **Skill Sync** — Preflight checks for skill synchronization between Claude Code and Codex CLI
- **Preflight Checks** — Validate tests, lint, nix hash, version sync, and skill sync before commits

### From Beads

- **Git as Database** — Issues stored as JSONL in `.beads/`, versioned with your code
- **Agent-Optimized** — JSON output, dependency tracking, auto-ready detection
- **Zero Conflict** — Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions
- **Background Sync** — Daemon auto-syncs changes

---

## Preflight Checks & Skill Sync

Run pre-commit checks to catch issues before they hit CI:

```bash
bd preflight              # Show checklist
bd preflight --check      # Run checks automatically
bd preflight --check --json  # JSON output for CI
bd preflight --check --auto-sync  # Auto-fix skill drift
```

**Checks included:**
- Skills synced (Claude Code ↔ Codex CLI)
- Tests pass (`go test -short ./...`)
- Lint passes (`golangci-lint run ./...`)
- Nix hash current (go.sum unchanged)
- Version sync (version.go matches default.nix)

**Skill sync integration:**
- Shadowbook detects when skills drift between Claude Code and Codex CLI
- Use `--auto-sync` to automatically sync missing skills
- Use `--compact-skills` on `bd close` to clean up unused skills

See [SHADOWBOOK_SKILL_SYNC_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md](specs/SHADOWBOOK_SKILL_SYNC_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md) for details.

## Filtering

```bash
# Exact spec match
bd list --spec specs/auth/login.md

# Prefix match (all auth specs)
bd list --spec specs/auth/

# Issues with spec drift
bd list --spec-changed

# Issues with no spec
bd list --no-spec
```

---

## Upstream Sync

Shadowbook tracks [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) as upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Why "Shadowbook"?

Every spec casts a shadow over the code implementing it. When the spec moves, the shadow should move too. Shadowbook makes sure your code notices.

---

## Positioning

Shadowbook answers a question other tools don't:

| Tool | Question it answers |
|------|---------------------|
| Spec Kit | How do I write specs? |
| Beads | What work needs doing? |
| **Shadowbook** | Is the work still aligned with the spec? |

Specs evolve. Shadowbook detects the drift and compacts what's done.
