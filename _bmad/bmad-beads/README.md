# BMAD-Beads: Mandatory Beads Task Tracking Module

Integrates Steve Yegge's Beads (`bd` CLI) as the **mandatory primary source of truth** for all BMAD task/todo generation, dependency tracking, status management, and workflow execution.

For conventions and usage details, see `_bmad/bmm/data/beads-conventions.md` after installation.\n\n## Key Changes\n\n- Agents **must** use `bd ready`, `bd create`, `bd dep add`, `bd close`, `bd sync` for tasks.\n- MD files: Specs/references only (no checklists).\n- Bidirectional sync keeps MD status/deps updated.\n\n## Components\n\n### Agents\n\n- **beads-sync.agent.yaml** - Bidirectional sync between MD stories and beads issues.\n\n### Workflows\n\n- **init-beads-from-stories** - Bulk migrate existing MD checklists to beads.\n\n## Installation\n\n**This module is mandatory and automatically installed** — The bmad-beads module is required for BMAD and cannot be deselected during installation. The Beads CLI (`bd`) is automatically provisioned to `_bmad/bin/bd` during BMAD installation.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Init beads: `bd init`\n2. Load module agents/workflows.\n3. Agents automatically use beads (prompts updated).\n\n## Module Structure\n\n`\nbmad-beads/\n├── module.yaml\n├── README.md\n├── agents/\n│   └── beads-sync.agent.yaml\n└── workflows/\n    └── init-beads-from-stories/\n`\n\n## Validation\n\nAfter updates, test workflows with beads (todo #10).\n\nPart of BMAD ecosystem.
