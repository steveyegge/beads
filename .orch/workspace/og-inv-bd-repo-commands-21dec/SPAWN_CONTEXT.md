TASK: bd repo commands - understand multi-repo functionality, reproduce JSON parsing bug, determine if cross-project epic support is viable. Context: pp7l found bd repo add fails with JSON parsing error even with valid config. Check: what does bd repo do, how is it supposed to work, is bug in parsing or config format?

🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment bd-h8ai "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:
1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment bd-h8ai "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/beads

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/beads)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation bd-repo-commands-understand-multi` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-bd-repo-commands-understand-multi.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately
   - **IMPORTANT:** After running `kb create`, report the actual path via:
     `bd comment bd-h8ai "investigation_path: /path/to/file.md"`
     (This allows orch complete to verify the correct file)
3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]
6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/beads/.orch/workspace/og-inv-bd-repo-commands-21dec/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/beads/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.

STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **bd-h8ai**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment bd-h8ai "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment bd-h8ai "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment bd-h8ai "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment bd-h8ai "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment bd-h8ai "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show bd-h8ai`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

# Investigation Skill

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

## The One Rule

**You cannot conclude without testing.**

If you didn't run a test, you don't get to fill the Conclusion section.

## Evidence Hierarchy

**Artifacts are claims, not evidence.**

| Source Type | Examples | Treatment |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Primary** (authoritative) | Actual code, test output, observed behavior | This IS the evidence |
| **Secondary** (claims to verify) | Workspaces, investigations, decisions | Hypotheses to test |

When an artifact says "X is not implemented," that's a hypothesis—not a finding to report. Search the codebase before concluding.

**The failure mode:** An agent reads a workspace claiming "feature X NOT DONE" and reports that as a finding without checking if feature X actually exists in the code.

## Workflow

1. Create investigation file: `kb create investigation {slug}`
2. Fill in your question
3. Try things, observe what happens
4. **Run a test to validate your hypothesis**
5. Fill conclusion only if you tested
6. Commit

## D.E.K.N. Summary

**Every investigation file starts with a D.E.K.N. summary block at the top.** This enables 30-second handoff to fresh Claude.

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Delta** | What was discovered/answered | "Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts" |
| **Evidence** | Primary evidence supporting conclusion | "Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests" |
| **Knowledge** | What was learned (insights, constraints) | "Agents follow documentation literally" |
| **Next** | Recommended action | "Add test-running instruction to template" |

**Fill D.E.K.N. at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.**

## Template

The template enforces the discipline. Use `kb create investigation {slug}` to create.

```markdown
## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** [What was discovered/answered]
**Evidence:** [Primary evidence supporting conclusion]
**Knowledge:** [What was learned]
**Next:** [Recommended action]
**Confidence:** [Level] ([%]) - [Key limitation]

---

# Investigation: [Topic]

**Question:** [What are you trying to figure out?]
**Status:** Active | Complete

## Findings
[Evidence gathered]

## Test performed
**Test:** [What you did to validate]
**Result:** [What happened]

## Conclusion
[Only fill if you tested]
```

## Common Failures

**"Logical verification" is not a test.**

Wrong:
```markdown
## Test performed
**Test:** Reviewed the code logic
**Result:** The implementation looks correct
```

Right:
```markdown
## Test performed
**Test:** Ran `time orch spawn investigation "test"` 5 times
**Result:** Average 6.2s, breakdown: 70ms orch overhead, 5.5s Claude startup
```

**Speculation is not a conclusion.**

Wrong:
```markdown
## Conclusion
Based on the code structure, the issue is likely X.
```

Right:
```markdown
## Conclusion
The test confirmed X is the cause. When I changed Y, the behavior changed to Z.
```

## When Not to Use

- **Fixing bugs** → Use `systematic-debugging`
- **Trivial questions** → Just answer them
- **Documentation** → Use `capture-knowledge`

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify investigation quality:

### Scope Verification

**Did you scope the problem with rg before concluding?**

| Check | How | If Failed |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Problem scoped** | Ran `rg` to find all occurrences of the pattern being investigated | Run now, update findings |
| **Scope documented** | Investigation states "Found X occurrences in Y files" | Add concrete numbers |
| **Broader patterns checked** | Searched for variations/related patterns | Document what else exists |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Investigating "how does auth work?"
rg "authenticate|authorize|jwt|token" --type py -l  # Scope: which files touch auth

# Investigating "why does X fail?"
rg "error.*X|X.*error" --type py  # Find all error handling for X

# Investigating "where is config loaded?"
rg "config|settings|env" --type py -l  # Scope the config surface area
```

**Why this matters:** Investigations that don't scope the problem often miss the full picture. "I found one place that does X" is less useful than "X happens in 3 files: A, B, C."

---

### Investigation-Specific Checks

| Check | Verification | If Failed |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Real test performed** | Not "reviewed code" or "analyzed logic" | Go back and test |
| **Conclusion from evidence** | Based on test results, not speculation | Rewrite conclusion |
| **Question answered** | Original question has clear answer | Complete the investigation |
| **Reproducible** | Someone else could follow your steps | Add detail |

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] **Test is real** - Ran actual command/code, not just "reviewed"
- [ ] **Evidence concrete** - Specific outputs, not "it seems to work"
- [ ] **Conclusion factual** - Based on observed results, not inference
- [ ] **No speculation** - Removed "probably", "likely", "should" from conclusion
- [ ] **Question answered** - Investigation addresses the original question
- [ ] **File complete** - All sections filled (not "N/A" or "None")
- [ ] **D.E.K.N. filled** - Replaced placeholders in Summary section (Delta, Evidence, Knowledge, Next)
- [ ] **NOT DONE claims verified** - If claiming something is incomplete, searched actual files/code to confirm (not just artifact claims)

### Discovered Work Check

*During this investigation, did you discover any of the following?*

| Type | Examples | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Bugs** | Broken functionality, edge cases that fail | `bd create "description" --type bug` |
| **Technical debt** | Workarounds, code that needs refactoring | `bd create "description" --type task` |
| **Enhancement ideas** | Better approaches, missing features | `bd create "description" --type feature` |
| **Documentation gaps** | Missing/outdated docs | Note in completion summary |

*When creating issues for discovered work, apply triage labels:*

| Confidence | Label | When to use |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| High | `triage:ready` | Clear problem, known fix approach, well-scoped |
| Lower | `triage:review` | Uncertain scope, needs orchestrator input |

Example:
```bash
bd create "Bug: edge case in validation" --type bug
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready  # or triage:review
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] **Reviewed for discoveries** - Checked investigation for patterns, bugs, or ideas beyond original scope
- [ ] **Tracked if applicable** - Created beads issues for actionable items (or noted "No discoveries")
- [ ] **Included in summary** - Completion comment mentions discovered items (if any)

**If no discoveries:** Note "No discovered work items" in completion comment. This is common and acceptable.

**Why this matters:** Investigations often reveal issues beyond the original question. Beads issues ensure these discoveries surface in SessionStart context rather than getting buried in investigation files.

### Document in Investigation File

At the end of your investigation file, add:

```markdown
## Self-Review

- [ ] Real test performed (not code review)
- [ ] Conclusion from evidence (not speculation)
- [ ] Question answered
- [ ] File complete

**Self-Review Status:** PASSED / FAILED
```

**Only proceed to commit after self-review passes.**

---

## Leave it Better (Mandatory)

**Before marking complete, externalize at least one piece of knowledge:**

| What You Learned | Command | Example |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| Made a choice with reasoning | `kn decide` | `kn decide "Use Redis for sessions" --reason "Need distributed state"` |
| Tried something that failed | `kn tried` | `kn tried "SQLite for sessions" --failed "Race conditions"` |
| Discovered a constraint | `kn constrain` | `kn constrain "API requires idempotency" --reason "Retry logic"` |
| Found an open question | `kn question` | `kn question "Should we rate-limit per-user or per-IP?"` |

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Reflected on session: What did I learn that the next agent should know?
- [ ] Externalized at least one item via `kn` command

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment: "Leave it Better: Straightforward investigation, no new knowledge to externalize."

---

## Completion

Before marking complete:

1. Self-review passed (see above)
2. **Leave it Better:** At least one `kn` command run OR noted as not applicable
3. `## Test performed` has a real test (not "reviewed code" or "analyzed logic")
4. `## Conclusion` is based on test results
5. D.E.K.N. summary filled (Delta, Evidence, Knowledge, Next)
6. `git add` and `git commit` the investigation file
7. Link artifact to beads issue: `kb link <investigation-file> --issue <beads-id>`
8. Report via beads: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [conclusion summary]"`
9. Close the beads issue: `bd close <beads-id> --reason "conclusion summary"`
10. Run `/exit` to close session

---

**Remember:** The old investigation system produced confident wrong conclusions. The fix is simple: test before concluding.
