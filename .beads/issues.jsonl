{"id":"bd-bx9","title":"bd init --contributor should configure sync.remote=upstream for fork workflows","description":"When running `bd init --contributor` in a fork workflow (where `upstream` remote points to the original repo), the wizard should configure beads to sync from `upstream/main` rather than `origin/main`.\n\n**Current behavior:**\n- Contributor mode detects the fork setup (upstream remote exists)\n- Sets up planning repo and auto-routing\n- Does NOT configure sync remote\n- `bd sync` on feature branches shows \"No upstream configured, using --from-main mode\" and syncs from `origin/main`\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Contributor mode should also set `sync.remote = upstream` (or similar config)\n- `bd sync` should pull beads from `upstream/main` (source of truth)\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- The fork's `origin/main` may be behind `upstream/main`\n- Contributors want the latest issues from the source repo\n- Code PRs go: local -\u003e origin -\u003e upstream, but beads should come FROM upstream\n\n**Suggested fix:**\nAdd to `runContributorWizard()` after detecting fork:\n```go\nif isFork {\n    store.SetConfig(ctx, \"sync.remote\", \"upstream\")\n}\n```","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-29T00:39:05.137488727-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-29T00:39:05.137488727-05:00","labels":["contributor","sync"]}
