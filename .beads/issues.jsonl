If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.19679-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00"}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc, bd-81abb639","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267237-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00"}

Start Amp with beads MCP server configured\n2. Call `mcp__beads__set_context(workspace_root=\"/path/to/project\")`\n3. Use MCP tools successfully (e.g., `mcp__beads__show`, `mcp__beads__list`)\n4. Restart Amp (new thread/session)\n5. Try to use MCP tools without calling `set_context` again\n6. **Result**: \"Not connected\" or \"No workspace set\" errors\n\n## Impact\n- Amp agents silently fail when trying to read/update beads issues\n- May attempt to create duplicate issues because they can't see existing ones\n- Potential for data corruption if operating on wrong database\n- Breaks multi-session workflows\n- Creates confusion: CLI works (`./bd`) but MCP tools don't\n\n## Current Workaround\nManually call `mcp__beads__set_context()` at start of every Amp session.\n\n## Root Cause\nMCP server is stateful and doesn't persist workspace context across restarts.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n**Option 1 (Best)**: Auto-detect workspace from current working directory\n- Match behavior of CLI `./bd` commands\n- Check for `.beads/` directory in current dir or parents\n- No manual context setting needed\n\n**Option 2**: Persist context in MCP server state file\n- Save last workspace_root to `~/.config/beads/mcp_context.json`\n- Restore on server startup\n\n**Option 3**: Require explicit context in every MCP call\n- Add optional `workspace_root` parameter to all MCP tools\n- Fall back to saved context if not provided\n\nAcceptance:\n- MCP tools work across Amp restarts without manual set_context()\n- Auto-detection matches CLI behavior (walks up from CWD)\n- Clear error message when no workspace found\n- set_context() still works for explicit override\n- BEADS_WORKING_DIR env var support\n- Integration test validates restart behavior","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T23:50:52.083111-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T23:58:44.397502-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-07T23:58:44.397502-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.3","title":"Implement global N-way collision resolution algorithm","description":"## Overview\nPhase 3: Replace pairwise collision resolution with global N-way resolution that produces deterministic results regardless of sync order.\n\n## Current Problem\nScoreCollisions (collision.go:228) compares issues pairwise:\n```go\ncollision.RemapIncoming = existingHash \u003c incomingHash\n```\n\nThis works for 2-way but fails for 3+ way because:\n- Each clone makes local decisions without global context\n- No guarantee intermediate states are consistent\n- Remapping decisions depend on sync order\n- Can't detect transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n\n## Solution\nImplement global resolution that:\n1. Collects ALL versions of same logical issue\n2. Sorts by content hash (deterministic)\n3. Assigns sequential IDs based on sorted order\n4. All clones converge to same assignments\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create ResolveNWayCollisions function\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions with:\n```go\n// ResolveNWayCollisions handles N-way collisions deterministically.\n// Groups all versions with same base ID, sorts by content hash,\n// assigns sequential IDs. Returns mapping of old ID → new ID.\nfunc ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    collisions []*CollisionDetail, incoming []*types.Issue) (map[string]string, error) {\n    \n    if len(collisions) == 0 {\n        return make(map[string]string), nil\n    }\n    \n    // Group by base ID pattern (e.g., test-1, test-2 → base \"test-1\")\n    groups := groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions)\n    \n    idMapping := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for baseID, versions := range groups {\n        // 1. Collect all unique versions by content hash\n        uniqueVersions := deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(versions)\n        \n        // 2. Sort by content hash (deterministic!)\n        sort.Slice(uniqueVersions, func(i, j int) bool {\n            return uniqueVersions[i].ContentHash \u003c uniqueVersions[j].ContentHash\n        })\n        \n        // 3. Assign sequential IDs based on sorted order\n        prefix := extractPrefix(baseID)\n        baseNum := extractNumber(baseID)\n        \n        for i, version := range uniqueVersions {\n            targetID := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d\", prefix, baseNum+i)\n            \n            // Map this version to its deterministic ID\n            if version.ID != targetID {\n                idMapping[version.ID] = targetID\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return idMapping, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// groupCollisionsByBaseID groups collisions by their logical base ID\nfunc groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions []*CollisionDetail) map[string][]*types.Issue {\n    groups := make(map[string][]*types.Issue)\n    for _, c := range collisions {\n        baseID := c.ID  // All share same ID (that's why they collide)\n        groups[baseID] = append(groups[baseID], c.ExistingIssue, c.IncomingIssue)\n    }\n    return groups\n}\n\n// deduplicateVersionsByContentHash keeps one issue per unique content hash\nfunc deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(issues []*types.Issue) []*types.Issue {\n    seen := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if _, found := seen[issue.ContentHash]; !found {\n            seen[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n        }\n    }\n    result := make([]*types.Issue, 0, len(seen))\n    for _, issue := range seen {\n        result = append(result, issue)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update handleCollisions in importer\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions call with:\n```go\n// OLD:\nif err := sqlite.ScoreCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult.Collisions, allExistingIssues); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to score collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// NEW:\nidMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n    collisionResult.Collisions, issues)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to resolve collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update RemapCollisions\nRemapCollisions currently uses collision.RemapIncoming field. Update to use idMapping directly:\n- Remove RemapIncoming logic\n- Use idMapping to determine what to remap\n- Simplify to just apply the computed mapping\n\n### 5. Add comprehensive tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. 3-way collision with different content → 3 sequential IDs\n2. 3-way collision with 2 identical content → 2 IDs (dedupe works)\n3. Sync order independence (A→B→C vs C→A→B produce same result)\n4. Content hash ordering is respected\n5. Works with 5+ clones\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ResolveNWayCollisions implemented and replaces ScoreCollisions\n- Groups all versions of same ID together\n- Deduplicates by content hash\n- Sorts by content hash deterministically\n- Assigns sequential IDs starting from base ID\n- Returns complete mapping (old ID → new ID)\n- All clones converge to same ID assignments\n- Works for arbitrary N-way collisions\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes (or gets much closer)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (new function, helpers)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (call new function)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (comprehensive tests)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- groupCollisionsByBaseID correctly groups\n- deduplicateVersionsByContentHash removes duplicates\n- Sorting by hash is stable and deterministic\n- Sequential ID assignment is correct\n\n### Integration Tests\n- 3-way collision resolves to 3 issues\n- Sync order doesn't affect final IDs\n- Content hash ordering determines winner\n\n### Property Tests\n- For any N clones with same content, all converge to same IDs\n- Idempotent: running resolution twice produces same result\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field) to be completed first\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection) for clean integration\n\n## Notes\nThis is the core algorithm that enables convergence. The key insight:\n**Sort by content hash globally, not pairwise comparison.**","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:37:42.85616-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.228707-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:03:26.675257-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.593102-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.30886-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.336312-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Multiple `bd daemon` processes can start in same workspace.\n\nExpected: One daemon per workspace (each workspace = separate .beads/ dir with bd.sock)\nActual: Multiple daemons can run simultaneously in same workspace\n\nNote: Separate git clones = separate workspaces = separate daemons (correct). Git worktrees share .beads/ and have known limitations (documented, use --no-daemon).","notes":"## Fix Summary\n\nSuccessfully prevented the nested .beads/.beads/ recursion bug by implementing two safeguards:\n\n1. **Path Canonicalization in FindDatabasePath()** (beads.go):\n   - Added filepath.Abs() + filepath.EvalSymlinks() to normalize all database paths\n   - Prevents relative path edge cases that create nested directories\n   - Ensures all daemons see the same canonical path\n\n2. **Nested Directory Detection** (daemon_lifecycle.go):\n   - Added explicit check for \".beads/.beads\" pattern in setupDaemonLock()\n   - Fails fast with clear error message if nested structure detected\n   - Provides user hints about proper usage\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe daemon lock (added Oct 22, 2025) correctly prevents simultaneous daemons in the SAME workspace. However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3. No infinite .beads/ recursion possible (tested nested BEADS_DB path)\n✅ 4.

{"id":"bd-710a4916","title":"CRDT-based architecture for guaranteed convergence (v2.0)","description":"## Vision\nRedesign beads around Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to provide mathematical guarantees for N-way collision resolution at arbitrary scale.\n\n## Current Limitations\n- Content-hash based collision resolution fails at 5+ clones\n- Non-deterministic convergence in multi-round scenarios\n- UNIQUE constraint violations during rename operations\n- No formal proof of convergence properties\n\n## CRDT Benefits\n- Provably convergent (Strong Eventual Consistency)\n- Commutative/Associative/Idempotent operations\n- No coordination required between clones\n- Scales to 100+ concurrent workers\n- Well-understood mathematical foundations\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### 1. UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T02:22:18.411871-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T00:54:51.171319-08:00"}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-09T16:13:23.940047-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T15:58:44.909873-08:00"}

This gives false confidence that everything is synced with the source of truth.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Start with database synced to working tree .beads/issues.jsonl (376 issues)\n2. Git HEAD has older version of .beads/issues.jsonl (354 issues)\n3. Run: bd import .beads/issues.jsonl\n4. Output: 'Import complete: 0 created, 0 updated'\n\n## Problem\n\nUser expects 'bd import' after 'git pull' to sync database with committed state, but:\n- Command silently succeeds because DB already matches working tree\n- No warning that working tree has uncommitted changes\n- User falsely believes everything is synced with git\n- Violates 'JSONL in git is source of truth' principle\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nWhen .beads/issues.jsonl differs from git HEAD, bd import should:\n1. Detect uncommitted changes: git diff --quiet HEAD .beads/issues.jsonl\n2. Warn user: 'Warning: .beads/issues.jsonl has uncommitted changes (376 lines vs 354 in HEAD)'\n3. Clarify status: 'Import complete: 0 created, 0 updated (already synced with working tree)'\n4. Recommend: 'Run git diff .beads/issues.jsonl to review uncommitted work'\n\n## Impact\n\n- Users can't trust 'bd import' status messages\n- Silent data loss risk if user assumes synced and runs git checkout\n- Breaks mental model of 'JSONL in git = source of truth'\n- Critical for VC's landing-the-plane workflow","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T23:51:28.536822-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T23:58:34.482313-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-07T23:58:34.482313-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-9bsx","title":"Recurring dirty state after merge conflicts - bd sync keeps failing","description":"## Problem\n\n`bd sync` consistently fails with merge conflicts in `.beads/beads.jsonl`, creating a loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync`\n2. Git merge conflict occurs\n3. User resolves with `git checkout --theirs` (takes remote)\n4. Daemon auto-exports database state (which has local changes)\n5. JSONL becomes dirty again immediately\n6. Repeat\n\nThis has been happening for **weeks** and is extremely frustrating.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe recommended conflict resolution (`git checkout --theirs`) throws away local database state (comments, dependencies, closed issues). The daemon then immediately re-exports, creating a dirty state.\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nManual `bd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push` after every failed sync.\n\n## Example Session\n\n```bash\n$ bd sync\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in .beads/beads.jsonl\n\n$ git checkout --theirs .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 bd import \u0026\u0026 git add \u0026\u0026 git commit \u0026\u0026 git push\n# Pushed successfully\n\n$ git status\nmodified: .beads/beads.jsonl  # DIRTY AGAIN!\n```\n\n## Lost Data in Recent Session\n\n- bd-ry1u closure (lost in merge)\n- Comments on bd-08fd, bd-23a8, bd-6049, bd-87a0 (lost)\n- Dependencies that existed only in local DB\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. **Use beads-merge tool** - Implement proper 3-way JSONL merge (bd-bzfy)\n2. **Smarter conflict resolution** - Detect when `--theirs` will lose data, warn user\n3. **Sync validation** - Check if JSONL == DB after merge, re-export if needed\n4. **Daemon awareness** - Pause auto-export during merge resolution\n5. **Transaction log** - Replay local changes after merge instead of losing them\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- bd-bzfy (beads-merge integration)\n- Possibly related to daemon auto-export behavior","notes":"## Solution Implemented\n\nFixed the recurring dirty state after merge conflicts by adding **sync validation** before re-exporting.\n\n### Root Cause\nLines 217-237 in `sync.go` unconditionally re-exported DB to JSONL after every import, even when they were already in sync. This created an infinite loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync` which pulls and imports remote JSONL\n2. Sync unconditionally re-exports DB (which has local changes)\n3. JSONL becomes dirty immediately\n4. Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-9826b69a","title":"CRDT-based architecture for guaranteed convergence (v2.0)","description":"## Vision\nRedesign beads around Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to provide mathematical guarantees for N-way collision resolution at arbitrary scale.\n\n## Current Limitations\n- Content-hash based collision resolution fails at 5+ clones\n- Non-deterministic convergence in multi-round scenarios\n- UNIQUE constraint violations during rename operations\n- No formal proof of convergence properties\n\n## CRDT Benefits\n- Provably convergent (Strong Eventual Consistency)\n- Commutative/Associative/Idempotent operations\n- No coordination required between clones\n- Scales to 100+ concurrent workers\n- Well-understood mathematical foundations\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### 1. UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-7a2b58fc","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:36:13.971527-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:27:29.41629-08:00"}

This causes:\n\n1. Race conditions: 8+ daemons watching same .beads/beads.db, each with own 30s debounce timer\n2. Git conflicts: Multiple daemons racing to commit/push .beads/issues.jsonl\n3. Resource waste: Orphaned daemons from sessions days/hours old still running\n\nExample: User had 8 daemons from multiple sessions (12:37AM, 7:20PM, 7:22PM, 7:47PM, 9:19PM yesterday + 9:54AM, 10:55AM today).\n\nSolutions to consider:\n1. Track parent PID and exit when parent dies\n2. Use single global daemon instead of per-session\n3. Document manual cleanup: pkill -f \"bd daemon\"\n4. Add daemon lifecycle management (auto-cleanup of stale daemons)","notes":"Implementation complete:\n\n1. Added ParentPID field to DaemonLockInfo struct (stored in daemon.lock JSON)\n2. Daemon now tracks parent PID via os.Getppid() at startup\n3. Both event loops (polling and event-driven) check parent process every 10 seconds\n4. Daemon gracefully exits if parent process dies (detected via isProcessRunning check)\n5. Handles edge cases:\n   - ParentPID=0: Older daemons without tracking (ignored)\n   - ParentPID=1: Adopted by init means parent died (exits)\n   - Otherwise checks if parent process is still running\n\nThe fix prevents daemon accumulation by ensuring orphaned daemons automatically exit within 10 seconds of parent death.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T18:48:41.65456-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T18:53:26.382573-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-07T18:53:26.382573-08:00"}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.207148-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T21:57:03.06641-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-e6d71828","title":"Add transaction + retry logic for N-way collision resolution","description":"## Problem\nCurrent N-way collision resolution fails on UNIQUE constraint violations during convergence rounds when 5+ clones sync. The RemapCollisions function is non-atomic and performs operations sequentially:\n1. Delete old issues (CASCADE deletes dependencies)\n2. Create remapped issues (can fail with UNIQUE constraint)\n3. Recreate dependencies\n4. Update text references\n\nFailure at step 2 leaves database in inconsistent state.\n\n## Solution\nWrap collision resolution in database transaction with retry logic:\n- Make entire RemapCollisions operation atomic\n- Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\n- Re-sync counters between retries\n- Add better error messages for debugging\n\n## Implementation\nLocation: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go:342 (RemapCollisions function)\n\n```go\n// Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\nfor attempt := 0; attempt \u003c 3; attempt++ {\n    err := s.db.ExecInTransaction(func(tx *sql.Tx) error {\n        // All collision resolution operations\n    })\n    if !isUniqueConstraintError(err) {\n        return err\n    }\n    s.SyncAllCounters(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 5-clone collision test passes reliably\n- No partial state on UNIQUE constraint errors\n- Automatic recovery from transient ID conflicts\n\n## References\n- See beads_nway_test.go:124 for the KNOWN LIMITATION comment\n- Related to-7c5915ae (transaction support)","notes":"## Progress Made\n\n1. Added `ExecInTransaction` helper to SQLiteStorage for atomic database operations\n2. Added `IsUniqueConstraintError` function to detect UNIQUE constraint violations\n3. Wrapped `RemapCollisions` with retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with counter sync between retries\n4. Enhanced `handleRename` to detect and handle race conditions where target ID already exists\n5. Added defensive checks for when old ID has been deleted by another clone\n\n## Test Results\n\nThe changes improve N-way collision handling but don't fully solve the problem:\n- Original error: `UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id` during first convergence round\n- With changes: Test proceeds further but encounters different collision scenarios\n- New error: `target ID already exists with different content` in later convergence rounds\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is more complex than initially thought. In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-e6d71828","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:44:44.14653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Add commands for inter-agent messaging.\n\n## Background\n- Agent Mail server running at http://127.0.0.1:8765\n- 12 workspaces configured across 3 channels (beads.dev, vc.dev, wyvern.dev)\n- Current integration: file reservations only\n- Gap: no way to send messages from bd CLI\n\n## Proposed Commands\n\n```bash\n# Send message to another agent\nbd message send \u003cto-agent\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e [options]\n  --subject \u003csubject\u003e\n  --thread-id \u003cthread-id\u003e     # Optional - group related messages\n  --project-id \u003cproject\u003e      # Defaults to BEADS_PROJECT_ID\n\n# List inbox messages\nbd message inbox [options]\n  --limit \u003cN\u003e\n  --unread-only\n\n# Read specific message\nbd message read \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n\n# Mark message as acknowledged\nbd message ack \u003cmessage-id\u003e\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```bash\n# Send message to agent in same channel\nbd message send cino-beads-stevey-macbook \"Working on bd-z0yn, need your review\" \\\n  --subject \"Review request\" \\\n  --thread-id bd-z0yn\n\n# Check inbox\nbd message inbox --unread-only\n\n# Read and acknowledge\nbd message read msg-abc123\nbd message ack msg-abc123\n```\n\n## Design Notes\n- Use same env vars (BEADS_AGENT_MAIL_URL, BEADS_AGENT_NAME, BEADS_PROJECT_ID)\n- Graceful degradation if Agent Mail unavailable\n- JSON output support for all commands\n- Consider integrating with bd update/close (auto-notify on status changes)\n\n## References\n- Agent Mail README: ~/src/mcp_agent_mail/README.md\n- Beads integration docs: docs/AGENT_MAIL.md","notes":"## Implementation Summary\n\nAdded four new commands to bd CLI for Agent Mail messaging:\n\n1. `bd message send \u003cto-agent\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e` - Send messages to other agents\n   - Flags: --subject, --thread-id, --importance, --ack-required\n   - Supports markdown content\n   - Thread conversations by issue ID\n\n2. `bd message inbox` - List inbox messages\n   - Flags: --limit, --unread-only, --urgent-only, --json\n   - Shows subject, sender, age, importance\n   - Highlights unread and ACK-required messages\n\n3. `bd message read \u003cmessage-id\u003e` - Read and mark message as read\n   - Automatically marks message as read\n   - Shows message content\n\n4. `bd message ack \u003cmessage-id\u003e` - Acknowledge a message\n   - Marks message as acknowledged\n   - Also marks as read if not already\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Uses JSON-RPC over HTTP to communicate with Agent Mail server\n- Configuration via environment variables (BEADS_AGENT_MAIL_URL, BEADS_AGENT_NAME, BEADS_PROJECT_ID)\n- Graceful error messages when Agent Mail not configured\n- Full JSON output support for programmatic use\n- Follows same patterns as existing bd commands\n\n## Documentation\n\nUpdated:\n- docs/AGENT_MAIL.md - Added \"Messaging Commands\" section with examples and best practices\n- README.md - Added \"Messaging (Agent Mail)\" section in Usage\n\n## Testing\n\n- Compiles successfully\n- Help output works correctly\n- Ready for integration testing with Agent Mail server","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-08T12:44:03.547806-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T12:49:02.436927-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T12:49:02.436927-08:00"}

Correctness: Does getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() handle all edge cases?\n2. Performance: Calling getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() 3x per sync (snapshot capture, merge, base update) - should we cache?\n3. Error handling: What if some repos fail snapshot operations but others succeed?\n4. Race conditions: Multiple daemons in different repos?\n5.

Overall assessment: Core deletion tracking logic is sound, but error handling and path handling issues make this not yet production-ready for multi-repo scenarios.\n\nKey findings:\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES (Priority 1):\n1. Inconsistent error handling in daemon_sync.go - snapshot/merge fail hard but base update warns. Can leave DB in inconsistent state with no rollback. See bd-sjmr.\n2. No path normalization in getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() - tilde expansion, relative paths, duplicates not handled. See bd-iye7.\n\nSHOULD FIX (Priority 2):\n3. Missing test coverage for edge cases - empty paths, duplicates, partial failures. See bd-kdoh.\n4. Performance - getMultiRepoJSONLPaths() called 3x per sync (minor issue). See bd-we4p.\n\nWHAT WORKS WELL:\n- Atomic file operations with PID-based temp files\n- Good snapshot isolation between repos\n- Race condition protection via exclusive locks\n- Solid test coverage for happy path scenarios\n\nVERDICT: Address bd-iye7 and bd-sjmr before considering deletion tracking production-ready for multi-repo mode.\n\nDetailed review notes available in conversation history.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:23:52.402949-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:32:34.160341-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:32:34.160341-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-xo6b","depends_on_id":"bd-rbxi","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:23:52.403723-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

MCP protocol adds session state support, OR\n2. We implement daemon RPC with per-request cwd (PATH 1.5), OR\n3. Client implementations can pass context with every tool call\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Immediate (keep current workaround):**\n- Use single MCP server with explicit BEADS_DB in config\n- Set BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 for safety\n- Call set_context at session start (even if env vars don't persist, it validates paths)\n\n**Medium-term (if needed):**\n- Implement PATH 1.5: Add cwd parameter to daemon RPC protocol\n- Update MCP server to use daemon client instead of direct CLI calls\n- Per-request context routing via daemon\n\n**Long-term (if \u003e50 repos):**\n- Implement PATH 2: Advanced routing daemon with repo→DB index\n\n## Original Notes\n[Previous investigation notes preserved above...]","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-17T02:06:09.737832-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.550071-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:54:35.196728-07:00"}

Add beads_alias_* Functions\n\n```python\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_list() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"List all alias mappings.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'list'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_set(alias: int, issue_id: str) -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Manually assign alias to issue.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'set', str(alias), issue_id], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n\n@server.call_tool()\nasync def beads_alias_compact() -\u003e List[TextContent]:\n    \"\"\"Compact aliases to fill gaps.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'alias', 'compact'], ...)\n    return [TextContent(type=\"text\", text=result.stdout)]\n```\n\n### 5. Update Documentation\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs (v2.0+)\n\nThe MCP server accepts both hash IDs and aliases:\n\n```python\n# Using hash IDs\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n\n# Using aliases\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\nawait beads_show(issue_id=\"42\")  # Shorthand\n```\n\n## Alias Management\n\nNew functions for alias control:\n\n- `beads_alias_list()` - List all alias mappings\n- `beads_alias_set(alias, issue_id)` - Manually assign alias\n- `beads_alias_compact()` - Compact aliases to fill gaps\n\n## Migration\n\nAfter migrating to hash IDs:\n1. Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) \u003e 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.256074-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.257315-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.258057-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-08T02:47:57.197927-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-20T19:00:15.571481-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T02:28:35.317704-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-dd6f6d26","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:12:56.345276-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Each clone is missing some issues that other clones have.\n\nFrom TestFiveCloneCollision results:\n- Clone A has: A, B\n- Clone B has: A, B  \n- Clone C has: A, B, C\n- Clone D has: A, B, C, D\n- Clone E has: A, B, C, E\n\n**Expected**: All clones should have A, B, C, D, E after final pull.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe current sync workflow does:\n1. Each clone syncs in order (resolving collisions locally)\n2. Final pull to get all changes\n\nBut the final pull itself may need import with collision resolution, which creates new commits. These new commits aren't propagated to other clones, so they remain incomplete.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Option 1: Multi-round final sync**\n- After final pull, do additional sync rounds until all clones converge\n- Check convergence by comparing issue counts or content hashes\n- Maximum N rounds for N clones\n\n**Option 2: Iterative pull-import-push**\n- Each clone: pull → import with --resolve-collisions → push\n- Repeat until no new changes\n- Guaranteed convergence but may create commit spam\n\n**Option 3: Fix auto-import to be truly idempotent**\n- Ensure importing same JSONL multiple times produces no new commits\n- May require smarter content-based deduplication\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes without t.Skip\n- All N clones have all N issues after convergence\n- Convergence happens in bounded rounds (≤ N)\n- No data loss or duplication\n- Works for arbitrary N (tested with 5, 10 clones)\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is the final blocker for bd-cbed9619 epic completion.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T21:22:21.486109-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.180996-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T11:02:40.756891-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-9ae788be","title":"Implement clone-scoped ID allocation to prevent N-way collisions","description":"## Problem\nCurrent ID allocation uses per-clone atomic counters (issue_counters table) that sync based on local database state. In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T02:22:18.413251-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T00:36:58.134558-08:00"}

Pull from remote\n5. bd sync --import-only fails with: 'Git conflict markers detected in JSONL file'\n\n**Root cause:**\nThe conflict detection appears to decode JSON before checking for conflict markers, causing false positives when issue content legitimately contains these strings.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nConflict detection should only trigger on actual git conflict markers (literal '\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c' bytes in the raw file), not on JSON-encoded content within issue fields.\n\n**Test case:**\nVC project at ~/src/dave/vc has vc-85 'JSONL Conflict Parser' which documents conflict parsing and triggers this bug.\n\n**Suggested fixes:**\n1. Only scan for literal '\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c' bytes (not decoded JSON content)\n2. Parse JSONL first and only flag unparseable lines\n3.

The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949061-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949064-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.4","title":"Make DetectCollisions read-only (separate detection from modification)","description":"## Overview\nPhase 2: Separate collision detection from state modification to enable safe, composable collision resolution.\n\n## Current Problem\nDetectCollisions (collision.go:38-111) modifies database state during detection:\n- Line 83-86: Deletes issues when content matches but ID differs\n- This violates separation of concerns\n- Causes race conditions when processing multiple issues\n- Makes contentToDBIssue map stale after first deletion\n- Partial failures leave DB in inconsistent state\n\n## Solution\nMake DetectCollisions purely read-only. Move all modifications to a separate ApplyCollisionResolution function.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add RenameDetail to CollisionResult\nFile: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go\n```go\ntype CollisionResult struct {\n    ExactMatches []string\n    Collisions   []*CollisionDetail\n    NewIssues    []string\n    Renames      []*RenameDetail  // NEW\n}\n\ntype RenameDetail struct {\n    OldID string        // ID in database\n    NewID string        // ID in incoming\n    Issue *types.Issue  // The issue with new ID\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Remove deletion from DetectCollisions\nReplace lines 83-86:\n```go\n// OLD (DELETE THIS):\nif err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, dbMatch.ID); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue...\")\n}\n\n// NEW (ADD THIS):\nresult.Renames = append(result.Renames, \u0026RenameDetail{\n    OldID: dbMatch.ID,\n    NewID: incoming.ID,\n    Issue: incoming,\n})\ncontinue  // Don't mark as NewIssue yet\n```\n\n### 3. Create ApplyCollisionResolution function\nNew function to apply all modifications atomically:\n```go\nfunc ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    result *CollisionResult, mapping map[string]string) error {\n    \n    // Phase 1: Handle renames (delete old IDs)\n    for _, rename := range result.Renames {\n        if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, rename.OldID); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue %s: %w\", \n                rename.OldID, err)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Create new IDs (from mapping)\n    // Phase 3: Update references\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update callers to use two-phase approach\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions)\n```go\n// Phase 1: Detect (read-only)\ncollisionResult, err := sqlite.DetectCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, issues)\n\n// Phase 2: Resolve (compute mapping)\nmapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult)\n\n// Phase 3: Apply (modify DB)\nerr = sqlite.ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult, mapping)\n```\n\n### 5. Update tests\n- Verify DetectCollisions doesn't modify DB\n- Test ApplyCollisionResolution separately\n- Add test for rename detection without modification\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- DetectCollisions performs zero writes to database\n- DetectCollisions returns RenameDetail entries for content matches\n- ApplyCollisionResolution handles all modifications\n- All existing tests still pass\n- New test verifies read-only detection\n- contentToDBIssue map stays consistent throughout detection\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (DetectCollisions, new function)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions caller)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (add tests)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: DetectCollisions with content match doesn't delete DB issue\n- Unit test: RenameDetail correctly populated\n- Unit test: ApplyCollisionResolution applies renames\n- Integration test: Full flow still works end-to-end\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nThis is a significant refactor of core collision logic. Recommend:\n1. Add comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Use feature flag to enable/disable new behavior\n3.

Refactor ImportIssues to be content-first\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\n```go\nfunc ImportIssues(ctx context.Context, dbPath string, store storage.Storage, \n    issues []*types.Issue, opts Options) (*Result, error) {\n    \n    result := \u0026Result{...}\n    \n    sqliteStore, needCloseStore, err := getOrCreateStore(ctx, dbPath, store)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    if needCloseStore {\n        defer func() { _ = sqliteStore.Close() }()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 1: Compute content hashes for all incoming issues\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        issue.ContentHash = issue.ComputeContentHash()\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Build content hash maps\n    incomingByHash := buildHashMap(issues)\n    dbIssues, _ := sqliteStore.SearchIssues(ctx, \"\", types.IssueFilter{})\n    dbByHash := buildHashMap(dbIssues)\n    dbByID := buildIDMap(dbIssues)\n    \n    // Phase 3: Content-first matching\n    var newIssues []*types.Issue\n    var idConflicts []*CollisionDetail\n    \n    for hash, incoming := range incomingByHash {\n        if existing, found := dbByHash[hash]; found {\n            // Same content exists\n            if existing.ID == incoming.ID {\n                // Exact match - idempotent case\n                result.Unchanged++\n            } else {\n                // Same content, different ID - rename detected\n                // Delete old ID, keep new ID (incoming is canonical)\n                if err := handleRename(ctx, sqliteStore, existing, incoming); err != nil {\n                    return nil, err\n                }\n                result.Updated++\n            }\n        } else {\n            // New content - check for ID collision\n            if existingWithID, found := dbByID[incoming.ID]; found {\n                // ID exists but different content - collision\n                idConflicts = append(idConflicts, \u0026CollisionDetail{\n                    ID:            incoming.ID,\n                    IncomingIssue: incoming,\n                    ExistingIssue: existingWithID,\n                })\n            } else {\n                // Truly new issue\n                newIssues = append(newIssues, incoming)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 4: Resolve ID conflicts using global algorithm\n    if len(idConflicts) \u003e 0 {\n        if !opts.ResolveCollisions {\n            return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"collision detected\")\n        }\n        \n        idMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n            idConflicts, issues)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        if err := applyIDMapping(ctx, sqliteStore, idMapping); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        \n        result.IDMapping = idMapping\n        result.Collisions = len(idConflicts)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 5: Create new issues\n    if len(newIssues) \u003e 0 {\n        if err := sqliteStore.CreateIssues(ctx, newIssues, \"import\"); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        result.Created = len(newIssues)\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 6: Import dependencies, labels, comments (existing logic)\n    // ...\n    \n    return result, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// buildHashMap creates a map of content hash → issue\nfunc buildHashMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// buildIDMap creates a map of ID → issue\nfunc buildIDMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ID] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// handleRename handles content match with different IDs\nfunc handleRename(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage, \n    existing *types.Issue, incoming *types.Issue) error {\n    \n    // Delete old ID\n    if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, existing.ID); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete old ID %s: %w\", existing.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Create with new ID\n    if err := s.CreateIssue(ctx, incoming, \"import-rename\"); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create renamed issue %s: %w\", \n            incoming.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Update references from old ID to new ID\n    idMapping := map[string]string{existing.ID: incoming.ID}\n    return updateReferences(ctx, s, idMapping)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic. Recommend:\n1. Comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Feature flag to enable/disable\n3. Keep old import code path for rollback\n4. Test with all existing import tests\n5. Manual testing with real repositories\n\n## Success Metrics\nAfter this phase:\n- TestThreeCloneCollision should PASS\n- All clones converge after final pull\n- Import is demonstrably idempotent\n- No data loss in N-way scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:38:25.671302-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.229134-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:21:39.529971-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.616846-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.360026-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.383624-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.407157-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Add schema probe in sqlite.New() after RunMigrations\n   - SELECT all expected columns from all tables with LIMIT 0\n   - If fails, retry RunMigrations and probe again\n   - If still fails, return fatal error with clear message\n2.

{"id":"bd-19","title":"Implement storage driver interface for pluggable backends","description":"Create abstraction layer for storage to support multiple backends (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, in-memory testing, etc.).\n\n**Current state:** All storage logic hardcoded to SQLite in internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite.go\n\n**Proposed design:**\n\n```go\n// internal/storage/storage.go\ntype Store interface {\n    // Issue CRUD\n    CreateIssue(issue *Issue) error\n    GetIssue(id string) (*Issue, error)\n    UpdateIssue(id string, updates *Issue) error\n    DeleteIssue(id string) error\n    ListIssues(filter *Filter) ([]*Issue, error)\n    \n    // Dependencies\n    AddDependency(from, to string, depType DependencyType) error\n    RemoveDependency(from, to string, depType DependencyType) error\n    GetDependencies(id string) ([]*Dependency, error)\n    \n    // Counters, stats\n    GetNextID(prefix string) (string, error)\n    GetStats() (*Stats, error)\n    \n    Close() error\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Better testing (mock/in-memory stores)\n- Future flexibility (Postgres, cloud APIs, etc.)\n- Clean architecture (business logic decoupled from storage)\n- Enable Turso or other backends without refactoring everything\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n1. Define Store interface in internal/storage/storage.go\n2. Refactor SQLiteStore to implement interface\n3. Update all commands to use interface, not concrete type\n4. Add MemoryStore for testing\n5. Add driver selection via config (storage.driver = sqlite|turso|postgres)\n6. Update tests to use interface\n\n**Note:** This is valuable even without adopting Turso. Good architecture practice.\n\n**Context:** From GH issue #2 RFC evaluation.

{"id":"bd-627d","title":"AI-supervised database migrations for safer schema evolution","description":"## Problem\n\nDatabase migrations can lose user data through edge cases that are hard to anticipate (e.g., GH #201 where bd migrate failed to set issue_prefix, or bd-d355a07d false positive data loss warnings). Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","notes":"## Progress\n\n### ✅ Phase 1: Migration Invariants (COMPLETED)\n\n**Implemented:**\n- Created internal/storage/sqlite/migration_invariants.go with 3 invariants\n- Updated RunMigrations() to verify invariants after migrations\n- All tests pass ✓\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: Inspection Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 1abe4e7 - \"Add migration inspection tools for AI agents (bd-627d Phase 2)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ bd migrate --inspect --json - Shows migration plan\n2. ✅ bd info --schema --json - Returns schema details\n3. ✅ Migration warnings system\n4. ✅ Documentation updated in AGENTS.md\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: MCP Tools (COMPLETED \u0026 PUSHED)\n\n**Commit:** 2493693 - \"Add MCP tools for migration inspection (bd-627d Phase 3)\"\n\n**Implemented:**\n1. ✅ inspect_migration(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n2. ✅ get_schema_info(workspace_root) tool in beads-mcp\n3. ✅ Abstract methods in BdClientBase\n4. ✅ CLI client implementations\n5. ✅ All tests pass\n\n**All phases complete!** Migration inspection fully integrated into MCP server.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-02T12:57:10.722048-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T14:31:25.095296-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T14:31:25.095308-08:00"}

Study working test patterns in init_test.go, list_test.go, etc.\n2. Ensure BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 is set\n3. Properly initialize database with bd init\n4. Use the command's global store, not a separate instance\n5.

{"id":"bd-8kde","title":"bd delete bulk operations fight with auto-import/daemon causing data resurrection","description":"When bulk deleting issues (e.g., 244 closed issues older than 24h), the process fights with auto-import and daemon infrastructure:\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n- Delete 244 issues from 468-issue database\n- Export to JSONL (224 lines)\n- Commit and push\n- Result: 224 issues\n\n**Actual behavior:**\n- Delete 244 issues \n- Import runs (from stale git JSONL with 468 issues)\n- Resurrects deleted issues back into database\n- Export writes 356 lines (not 224)\n- Math: 468 - 244 = 224, but got 356 (132 issues resurrected)\n\n**Root cause:**\nAuto-import keeps re-importing from git during the delete operation, before the new JSONL is committed. The workflow is:\n1. Delete from DB\n2. Auto-import runs (reads old JSONL from git with deleted issues still present)\n3. Issues come back\n4. Export writes partially-deleted state\n\n**Solution options:**\n1. Add `--no-auto-import` flag to bulk delete operations\n2. Atomic delete-export-commit operation that suppresses imports\n3. Dedicated `bd prune` command that handles this correctly\n4. Lock file to prevent auto-import during bulk mutations\n\n**Impact:**\n- Bulk cleanup operations don't work reliably\n- Makes it nearly impossible to prune old closed issues\n- Confusing UX (delete 244, but only 112 actually removed)","notes":"**FIXED**: Auto-import now skips during delete operations to prevent resurrection.\n\n**Root cause confirmed**: Auto-import was running in PersistentPreRun before delete executed, causing it to re-import stale JSONL from git and resurrect deleted issues.\n\n**Solution implemented**:\n1. Added delete to skip list in main.go PersistentPreRun (alongside import and sync --dry-run)\n2. Delete operations now complete atomically without auto-import interference\n3. Added comprehensive test (TestBulkDeleteNoResurrection) to prevent regression\n\n**Test verification**:\n- Creates 20 issues, deletes 10\n- Verifies no resurrection after delete\n- Confirms JSONL has correct count (10 remaining)\n- All existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-08T03:01:09.796852-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T03:06:04.416994-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T03:06:04.416994-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-5aad5a9c","title":"Add TestNWayCollision for 5+ clones","description":"## Overview\nAdd comprehensive tests for N-way (5+) collision resolution to verify the solution scales beyond 3 clones.\n\n## Purpose\nWhile TestThreeCloneCollision validates the basic N-way case, we need to verify:\n1. Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:52:05.462747-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00"}

README.md\nAdd section explaining hash IDs:\n```markdown\n## Issue IDs\n\nBeads uses **hash-based IDs** for collision-free distributed issue tracking:\n\n- **Hash ID**: `bd-af78e9a2` (8-char SHA256 prefix, immutable, globally unique)\n- **Alias**: `#42` (sequential number, mutable, human-friendly)\n\n### Using IDs\n```bash\nbd show bd-af78e9a2   # Use hash ID\nbd show #42           # Use alias\nbd show 42            # Use alias (shorthand)\n```\n\n### Why Hash IDs?\n- **Collision-free**: Work offline without ID conflicts\n- **Distributed**: No coordination needed between clones\n- **Git-friendly**: Different IDs = different JSONL lines, fewer merge conflicts\n\n### Aliases\nAliases are workspace-local shortcuts for hash IDs. They're:\n- Automatically assigned on issue creation\n- Reassigned deterministically on sync (if conflicts)\n- Can be manually controlled with `bd alias` commands\n```\n\n### 2. AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5. MIGRATION.md (new file)\n```markdown\n# Migrating to Hash-Based IDs (v2.0)\n\n## Overview\nBeads v2.0 introduces hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems. This is a **breaking change** requiring migration.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Backup\n```bash\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup\ngit commit -am \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6. CHANGELOG.md\n```markdown\n## v2.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **Hash-based IDs**: Issues now use collision-free hash IDs (bd-af78e9a2)\n  instead of sequential IDs (bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda)\n- **Aliasing system**: Human-friendly aliases (#42) for hash IDs\n- **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate --hash-ids` to convert v1.x databases\n\n### Added\n- `bd alias` command for manual alias control\n- `bd migrate --hash-ids` migration tool\n- Alias conflict resolution (deterministic, content-hash ordering)\n\n### Removed\n- ID collision detection and resolution (~2,100 LOC)\n- `bd import --resolve-collisions` flag (no longer needed)\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Zero ID collisions in distributed workflows\n- ✅ Simpler codebase (-1,350 net LOC)\n- ✅ Better git merge behavior\n- ✅ True offline-first operation\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Build docs locally (if using doc generator)\n- Check all links work\n- Verify examples are correct\n- Spellcheck\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- README.md (hash ID section)\n- AGENTS.md (workflow updates)\n- ADVANCED.md (internals)\n- MIGRATION.md (new)\n- CHANGELOG.md (v2.0 entry)\n- docs/ (any other docs)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.979971-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981344-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981767-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.13","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.982167-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

{"id":"bd-cbed9619.5","title":"Add content-addressable identity to Issue type","description":"## Overview\nPhase 1: Add content hashing to enable global identification of issues regardless of their assigned IDs.\n\n## Current Problem\nThe system identifies issues only by ID (e.g., test-1, test-2). When multiple clones create the same ID with different content, there's no way to identify that these are semantically different issues without comparing all fields.\n\n## Solution\nAdd a ContentHash field to the Issue type that represents the canonical content fingerprint.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add ContentHash field to Issue type\nFile: internal/types/types.go\n```go\ntype Issue struct {\n    ID          string\n    ContentHash string  // SHA256 of canonical content\n    // ... existing fields\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add content hash computation method\nUse existing hashIssueContent from collision.go:186 as foundation:\n```go\nfunc (i *Issue) ComputeContentHash() string {\n    return hashIssueContent(i)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Compute hash at creation time\n- Modify CreateIssue to compute and store ContentHash\n- Modify CreateIssues (batch) to compute hashes\n\n### 4.

Running 'bd import' hangs indefinitely.\n\nReproduction context:\n- VC repo: 1137 issues in DB, 309 in JSONL\n- Created 4 new issues with bd create\n- bd export didn't write them to JSONL\n- bd import hung (possibly daemon lock conflict?)\n\nNeed to investigate:\n1. Why export doesn't update JSONL when DB has more issues\n2. Why import hangs\n3. Daemon lock interaction with export/import\n4. File path handling (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl)","notes":"## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue was NOT about file path handling or export failing to update JSONL. The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring. The code uses `filepath.Glob(\"*.jsonl\")` which correctly finds ANY `.jsonl` file in `.beads/` directory, so both filenames work.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:00:55.78797-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00"}

Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.974702-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00"}

Validate migration tool works on real data\n2. Discover edge cases\n3. Verify all workflows still work\n4. Build confidence for users\n\n## Pre-Migration Checklist\n- [ ] All bd-f8b764c9 child tasks completed\n- [ ] All tests pass: `go test ./...`\n- [ ] Migration tool tested on test databases\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] MCP server updated and published\n- [ ] Clean git status\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Create Backup\n```bash\n# Backup database\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup-1761798568\n\n# Backup JSONL\ncp .beads/beads.jsonl .beads/beads.jsonl.backup\n\n# Create git branch for migration\ngit checkout -b hash-id-migration\ngit add .beads.backup-*\ngit commit -m \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration (Dry Run)\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run \u003e migration-plan.txt\ncat migration-plan.txt\n\n# Review:\n# - Number of issues to migrate\n# - Hash collision check (should be zero)\n# - Text reference updates\n# - Dependency updates\n```\n\n### 3. Run Migration (Real)\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids 2\u003e\u00261 | tee migration-log.txt\n\n# Expected output:\n# ✓ Backup created: .beads/beads.db.backup-1234567890\n# ✓ Generated 150 hash IDs\n# ✓ No hash collisions detected\n# ✓ Updated issues table schema\n# ✓ Updated 150 issue IDs\n# ✓ Updated 87 dependencies\n# ✓ Updated 234 text references\n# ✓ Exported to .beads/beads.jsonl\n# ✓ Migration complete!\n```\n\n### 4. Validation\n\n#### Database Integrity\n```bash\n# Check all issues have hash IDs\nbd list | grep -v \"bd-[a-f0-9]\\{8\\}\" \u0026\u0026 echo \"FAIL: Non-hash IDs found\"\n\n# Check all issues have aliases\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues WHERE alias IS NULL\"\n# Should be 0\n\n# Check no alias duplicates\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"SELECT alias, COUNT(*) FROM issues GROUP BY alias HAVING COUNT(*) \u003e 1\"\n# Should be empty\n```\n\n#### Functionality Tests\n```bash\n# Test show by hash ID\nbd show bd-\n\n# Test show by alias\nbd show #1\n\n# Test create new issue\nbd create \"Test issue after migration\" -p 2\n# Should get hash ID + alias\n\n# Test update\nbd update #1 --priority 1\n\n# Test dependencies\nbd dep tree #1\n\n# Test export\nbd export\ngit diff .beads/beads.jsonl\n# Should show hash IDs\n```\n\n#### Text Reference Validation\n```bash\n# Check that old IDs were updated in descriptions\ngrep -r \"bd-[0-9]\\{1,3\\}[^a-f0-9]\" .beads/beads.jsonl \u0026\u0026 echo \"FAIL: Old ID format found\"\n\n# Verify hash ID references exist\ngrep -o \"bd-[a-f0-9]\\{8\\}\" .beads/beads.jsonl | sort -u | wc -l\n# Should match number of hash IDs\n```\n\n### 5. Commit Migration\n```bash\ngit add .beads/beads.jsonl .beads/beads.db\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\n\n- Migrated 150 issues to hash IDs\n- Preserved aliases (#1-#150)\n- Updated 87 dependencies\n- Updated 234 text references\n- Zero hash collisions\n\nMigration log: migration-log.txt\"\n\ngit push origin hash-id-migration\n```\n\n### 6. Create PR\n```bash\ngh pr create --title \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\" --body \"## Summary\nMigrates beads project to hash-based IDs as part of v2.0 release.\n\n## Migration Stats\n- Issues migrated: 150\n- Dependencies updated: 87\n- Text references updated: 234\n- Hash collisions: 0\n- Aliases assigned: 150\n\n## Validation\n- ✅ All tests pass\n- ✅ Database integrity verified\n- ✅ All workflows tested (show, update, create, deps)\n- ✅ Text references updated correctly\n- ✅ Export produces valid JSONL\n\n## Files Changed\n- `.beads/beads.jsonl` - Hash IDs in all entries\n- `.beads/beads.db` - Schema updated with aliases\n\n## Rollback\nIf issues arise:\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nmv .beads.backup-1234567890 .beads\nbd export\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nSee migration-log.txt for full details.\"\n```\n\n### 7.

{"id":"bd-1863608e","title":"Add TestNWayCollision for 5+ clones","description":"## Overview\nAdd comprehensive tests for N-way (5+) collision resolution to verify the solution scales beyond 3 clones.\n\n## Purpose\nWhile TestThreeCloneCollision validates the basic N-way case, we need to verify:\n1. Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182217-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:47:28.317007-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-325da116","title":"Fix N-way collision convergence","description":"Epic to fix the N-way collision convergence problem documented in n-way-collision-convergence.md.\n\n## Problem Summary\nThe current collision resolution implementation works correctly for 2-way collisions but does not converge for 3-way (and by extension N-way) collisions. TestThreeCloneCollision demonstrates this with reproducible failures.\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n1. Pairwise resolution doesn't scale - each clone makes local decisions without global context\n2. DetectCollisions modifies state during detection (line 83-86 in collision.go)\n3. No remapping history - can't track transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n4. Import-time resolution is too late - happens after git merge\n\n## Solution Architecture\nReplace pairwise resolution with deterministic global N-way resolution using:\n- Content-addressable identity (content hashing)\n- Global collision resolution (sort all versions by hash)\n- Read-only detection phase (separate from modification)\n- Idempotent imports (content-first matching)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes without skipping\n- All clones converge to identical content after final pull\n- No data loss (all issues present in all clones)\n- Works for N workers (test with 5+ clones)\n- Idempotent imports (importing same JSONL multiple times is safe)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nSee child issues for detailed breakdown of each phase.","status":"closed","issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.889079-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00"}

Either provide workspace_root\n  parameter or call set_context() first.\n```\n\nHypothesis: Environment variable persistence issue between MCP tool calls, or ContextVar not being set correctly by @with_workspace decorator.\n\n**Error 2: \"Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit\"**\n```\n✗ list\n  Error calling tool 'list': Separator is found, but chunk is longer than limit\n```\n\nHypothesis: MCP protocol output size limit exceeded. Large issue databases may produce JSON output that exceeds MCP stdio buffer limits.\n\nPlatform: Fedora 43, using copilot-cli with Sonnet 4.5\n\nWorkaround: CLI works fine (`bd list --status open --json`)","notes":"## Fixes Implemented\n\n**Issue 1: \"No workspace set\" after successful set_context** ✅ FIXED\n\nRoot cause: os.environ doesn't persist across MCP tool calls. When set_context() set BEADS_WORKING_DIR in os.environ, that change was lost on the next tool call.\n\nSolution:\n- Added module-level _workspace_context dict for persistent storage (server.py:51)\n- Modified set_context() to store in both persistent dict and os.environ (server.py:265-287)\n- Modified with_workspace() decorator to check persistent context first (server.py:129-133)\n- Updated where_am_i() to check persistent context (server.py:302-330)\n\n**Issue 2: \"chunk longer than limit\"** ✅ FIXED\n\nRoot cause: MCP stdio protocol has buffer limits. Large issue lists with full dependencies/dependents exceed this.\n\nSolution:\n- Reduced default list limit from 50 to 20 (server.py:356, models.py:122)\n- Reduced max list limit from 1000 to 100 (models.py:122)\n- Strip dependencies/dependents from list() and ready() responses (server.py:343-350, 368-373)\n- Full dependency details still available via show() command\n\n## Testing\n\n✅ Python syntax validated with py_compile\n✅ Changes are backward compatible\n✅ Persistent context falls back to os.environ for compatibility\n\nUsers should now be able to call set_context() once and have it persist across all subsequent tool calls. Large databases will no longer cause buffer overflow errors.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-07T14:32:18.315155-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-07T21:02:55.470937-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-07T16:53:46.929942-08:00"}

Provide bd migrate --hash-ids tool.\n\n## Timeline\n~9 weeks (Phase 1: Hash IDs 4w, Phase 2: Aliases 3w, Phase 3: Testing 2w)\n\n## Dependencies\nShould complete after bd-7c5915ae (cleanup validation) and before bd-710a4916 (CRDT).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:23:49.592315-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.6038-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.6038-07:00"}

Consider if 50 is the right limit (why not 100? why not 20?)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Most hierarchies are 2-5 levels deep\n- But pathological cases (malicious or accidental) could create 50+ level nesting\n- Need to ensure graceful degradation, not catastrophic failure\n\n**Implementation:**\nAdd TestDeepHierarchyBlocking to ready_test.go","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.547807-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-18T16:47:05.347564-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-srwk","title":"bd export should detect and prevent stale database exports","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen `bd export` is run with a stale database (older than issues.jsonl), it silently overwrites the JSONL file with stale data, causing data loss.\n\n## What Happened (vc project)\n\n1. Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3. Agent B had stale database (from before step 1)\n4. Agent B worked on unrelated issue and exported (commit 0609233)\n5. Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1. Check .db, .db-wal, .db-shm timestamps (use newest for WAL mode)\n2. Check issues.jsonl timestamp\n3. If JSONL is newer by \u003e1 second: database is stale\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd staleness check in `bd export`:\n\n```go\nfunc Export(dbPath, jsonlPath string, force bool) error {\n    // Check if database is stale\n    if !force {\n        if err := checkDatabaseFreshness(dbPath, jsonlPath); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"database is stale: %w\\n\" +\n                \"Run 'bd import %s' first to sync, or use --force to override\",\n                err, jsonlPath)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with export...\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High (silent data loss)\n- **Frequency**: Happens in multi-agent workflows when agents don't sync\n- **Workaround**: Manual recovery (re-export from correct database)\n\n## References\n\n- VC issue tracker: commits 58b4613 -\u003e 0609233 -\u003e c41c638\n- VC has similar check: `storage.ValidateDatabaseFreshness()`\n- Tolerance: 1 second (handles filesystem timestamp precision)","notes":"Fixed with ID-based comparison instead of just count. Now detects:\n1. DB has fewer issues than JSONL (count check)\n2. DB has different issues than JSONL (ID comparison)\n\nBoth scenarios now properly refuse export unless --force is used.\n\nImplementation uses getIssueIDsFromJSONL() to build a set of IDs from JSONL, then checks if any JSONL IDs are missing from DB.
