{"id":"bd-4zy","title":"Import silently skips issues in deletions manifest","description":"**Problem**: When JSONL has valid issues but the deletions manifest lists them as deleted, bd import returns '0 created, 0 updated' with NO warning. This is confusing because issues exist in JSONL but aren't imported.\n\n**Expected behavior**: \n- At minimum: warn that N issues were skipped due to deletions manifest\n- Better: offer to restore them or show what's being skipped\n\n**Requirements**:\n1. Add warning message when issues are skipped due to deletions\n2. Show count and optionally list IDs of skipped issues\n3. Consider --force flag to import anyway (ignoring deletions)\n\n**Files to check**: cmd/bd/import.go, internal/importer/","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-30T21:14:47.146103-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T21:21:33.428328-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-30T21:21:33.428328-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented filtering of deleted issues during import with warning message and --ignore-deletions flag"}
