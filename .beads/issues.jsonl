Error handling\n\n- File doesn't exist → clear error message\n- File not readable → clear error message\n- stdin specified but not available → clear error message\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ **Matches training data**: `gh issue create --body-file file.txt` is a common pattern\n✅ **No shell escaping issues**: File content is read directly\n✅ **Works with any content**: Markdown, special characters, quotes, etc.\n✅ **Agent-friendly**: Agents already write complex content to temp files\n✅ **User-friendly**: Easier for humans too when pasting long descriptions\n\n## Related Commands\n\nConsider adding similar support to:\n- `bd update --body-file` (for updating descriptions)\n- `bd comment --body-file` (if/when we add comments)\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# From file\nbd create --title=\"Add new feature\" --body-file=feature.md\n\n# From stdin\necho \"Quick description\" | bd create --title=\"Bug fix\" --body-file=-\n\n# With other flags\nbd create \\\n  --title=\"Security issue\" \\\n  --type=bug \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --body-file=security-report.md \\\n  --label=security\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Test with normal files\n- Test with stdin (`-`)\n- Test with non-existent files (error handling)\n- Test with binary files (should handle gracefully)\n- Test with empty files (valid - empty description)\n- Test that `--description-file` and `--body-file` are equivalent aliases","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:13:40.536024-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T17:28:52.505239-08:00"}

JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","status":"closed","issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:13:40.531403-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T16:50:59.510972-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-ndye","title":"mergeDependencies uses union instead of 3-way merge","description":"## Critical Bug\n\nThe `mergeDependencies` function in internal/merge/merge.go performs a UNION of left and right dependencies instead of a proper 3-way merge. This causes removed dependencies to be resurrected.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n```go\n// Current code (lines 795-816):\nfunc mergeDependencies(left, right []Dependency) []Dependency {\n    // Just unions left + right\n    // NEVER REMOVES anything\n    // Doesn't even look at base!\n}\n```\n\nAnd `mergeIssue` (line 579) doesn't pass `base`:\n```go\nresult.Dependencies = mergeDependencies(left.Dependencies, right.Dependencies)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nIf:\n- Base has dependency D\n- Left removes D (intentional)\n- Right still has D (stale)\n\nCurrent: D is in result (resurrection!)\nCorrect: Left removed it, D should NOT be in result\n\nThis breaks Gas Town's workflow and data integrity. Closed means closed.\n\n### Fix\n\nChange `mergeDependencies` to take `base` and do proper 3-way merge:\n- If dep was in base and removed by left → exclude (left wins)\n- If dep was in base and removed by right → exclude (right wins)\n- If dep wasn't in base and added by either → include\n- If dep was in base and both still have it → include\n\nKey principle: **REMOVALS ARE AUTHORITATIVE**\n\n### Files to Change\n\n1. internal/merge/merge.go:\n   - `mergeDependencies(left, right)` → `mergeDependencies(base, left, right)`\n   - `mergeIssue` line 579: pass `base.Dependencies`\n\n### Related\n\nThis also explains why `ProtectLocalExportIDs` in importer is defined but never used - the protection was never actually implemented.","status":"closed","issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T23:15:54.475872-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00"}

This is a breaking change for MCP clients.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nBreaking change affects:\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from ready()\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from list()\n- Client code that accesses full Issue fields (description, design, acceptance_criteria, timestamps, dependencies, dependents)\n\n## Current Behavior\n- ready() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- list() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- show() still returns full `Issue` (good)\n\n## Considerations\n**Pros of current approach:**\n- Forces clients to use show() for full details (good for context efficiency)\n- Simple mental model (always use show for full data)\n- Documentation warns about this\n\n**Cons:**\n- Clients expecting list[Issue] will break\n- No graceful degradation option\n- No migration period\n\n## Potential Solutions\n1. Add optional parameter `full_details=false` to ready/list (would increase payload)\n2. Create separate tools: ready_minimal/list_minimal + ready_full/list_full\n3. Accept breaking change and document upgrade path (current approach)\n4. Version the MCP server and document migration guide\n\n## Recommendation\nCurrent approach (solution 3) is reasonable if:\n- Changelog clearly documents the breaking change\n- Migration guide provided to clients\n- Error handling is graceful for clients expecting specific fields","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.460465-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.460465-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-pdr2","depends_on_id":"bd-otf4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-12-14T14:24:56.461959-08:00","created_by":"stevey","metadata":"{}"}]}

{"id":"bd-r6a","title":"Redesign workflow system: templates as native Beads","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current workflow system (YAML templates in cmd/bd/templates/workflows/) is architecturally flawed:\n\n1. **Out-of-band data plane** - YAML files are a parallel system outside Beads itself\n2. **Heavyweight DSL** - YAML is gross; even TOML would have been better, but neither is ideal\n3. **Not graph-native** - Beads IS already a dependency graph with priorities, so why reinvent it?\n4. **Can't use bd commands on templates** - They're opaque YAML, not viewable/editable Beads\n\n## The Right Design\n\n**Templates should be Beads themselves.**\n\nA \"workflow template\" should be:\n- An epic marked as a template (via label, type, or prefix like `tpl-`)\n- Child issues with dependencies between them (using normal bd dep)\n- Titles and descriptions containing `{{variable}}` placeholders\n- Normal priorities that control serialization order\n\n\"Instantiation\" becomes:\n1. Clone the template subgraph (epic + children + dependencies)\n2. Substitute variables in titles/descriptions\n3. Generate new IDs for all cloned issues\n4. Return the new epic ID\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **No YAML** - Templates are just Beads\n- **Use existing tools** - `bd show`, `bd edit`, `bd dep` work on templates\n- **Graph-native** - Dependencies are real Beads dependencies\n- **Simpler codebase** - Remove all the YAML parsing/workflow code\n- **Composable** - Templates can reference other templates\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. Delete the YAML workflow system code (revert recent push + remove existing workflow code)\n2. Design template marking convention (label? type? id prefix?)\n3. Implement `bd template create` or `bd clone --as-template`\n4. Implement `bd template instantiate \u003ctemplate-id\u003e --var key=value`\n5.
