All tests appear to pass when examined individually\n2. Likely causes:\n   - Race detector finding data races during test cleanup (`-race` flag)\n   - Panic/error occurring after main tests complete\n   - Test harness issue not reporting actual failure\n   - Possible regression from PR #203 (dependency_type changes)\n\n## Recent CI Runs\n- Run 19015040655 (latest): 3/4 failing\n- Multiple recent commits tried to fix Windows/lint issues\n- Agent on rrnewton/beads fork attempting fixes (2/4 passing there)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Run tests locally with `-race -v` to see full output\n2. Check for unreported test failures or panics\n3. Examine test cleanup/teardown code\n4. Review recent changes around close command tests\n5. Consider if race detector is too sensitive or catching real issues","notes":"## Progress Update\n\n### ✅ Fixed (commits 09bd4d3, 21a29bc)\n1. **Daemon auto-import** - Always recompute content_hash in importer to avoid stale hashes\n2. **TestScripts failures** - Added bd binary to PATH for shell subprocess tests\n3. **Test infrastructure** - Added .gitignore to test repos, fixed last_import_time metadata\n\n### ✅ CI Status (Run 19015638968)\n- **Test (Linux)**: ✅ SUCCESS - All tests passing\n- **Test (Windows)**: ❌ FAILURE - Pre-existing Windows test failures\n- **Test Nix Flake**: ❌ FAILURE - Build fails with same test errors\n- **Lint**: ❌ FAILURE - Pre-existing issue in migrate.go:647\n\n### ❌ Remaining Issues (not related to original bd-1231)\n\n**Windows failures:**\n- TestFindDatabasePathEnvVar\n- TestHashIDs_MultiCloneConverge  \n- TestHashIDs_IdenticalContentDedup\n- TestDatabaseReinitialization (5 subtests)\n- TestFindBeadsDir_NotFound\n- TestMetricsSnapshot/uptime\n\n**Lint failure:**\n- cmd/bd/migrate.go:647:37: cleanupWALFiles - result 0 (error) is always nil (unparam)\n\n**Nix failure:**\n- Build fails during test phase with same test errors\n\n### Next Steps\n1.

Appends (or creates) AGENTS.md with beads workflow instructions\n2. Includes command examples, issue types, priorities, and workflow\n3. Adds note to CLAUDE.md if it exists, directing agents to use beads\n4. Makes it clear agents should abandon markdown TODOs in favor of bd\n5. Idempotent - safe to run multiple times\n\nThe onboarding content should emphasize:\n- Use bd for ALL task tracking, not markdown TODOs\n- How to check ready work, create/update/close issues\n- When to use discovered-from dependencies\n- Priority and issue type conventions\n- Auto-sync behavior\n\nThis will reduce onboarding friction and prevent agents from creating parallel tracking systems.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-20T14:34:52.483607-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.533645-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T14:57:39.014109-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Database filename (`wy-.db` → `wy-` prefix), OR\n2. Most recently used prefix in the database, OR  \n3. Prefix stored in metadata table\n\nAccording to `bd init --help`:\n\u003e -p, --prefix string   Issue prefix (default: current directory name)\n\nBut database filename convention appears to be `\u003cprefix\u003e.db`, so wy-.db should mean wy- is the intended prefix.\n\n**Workaround:**\nUse explicit `--id` flag: `bd create task \"title\" --id wy-73`\n\n**Reproduction:**\n```bash\n# In a directory with .beads/wy-.db containing wy-* issues\nbd create task \"test\"\n# Creates bd-* issue instead of wy-* issue\n```\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\n1. Store the intended prefix in metadata table during `bd init`\n2. When creating issues, check metadata for preferred prefix\n3. Fallback to extracting prefix from database filename\n4. Last resort: use directory name\n\n**Related Code:**\nLikely in issue counter/ID generation logic where new IDs are assigned.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-20T22:10:24.611471-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.534633-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T22:16:25.606694-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.954306-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.182217-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:47:28.317007-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Define Store interface in internal/storage/storage.go\n2. Refactor SQLiteStore to implement interface\n3. Update all commands to use interface, not concrete type\n4. Add MemoryStore for testing\n5. Add driver selection via config (storage.driver = sqlite|turso|postgres)\n6. Update tests to use interface\n\n**Note:** This is valuable even without adopting Turso. Good architecture practice.\n\n**Context:** From GH issue #2 RFC evaluation. Driver interface is low-cost, high-value regardless of whether we add alternative backends.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.536265-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T23:46:22.447301-07:00","source_repo":"."}

The actual problem was:\n\n**Import/Export hanging when daemon is running** due to SQLite lock contention:\n\n1. When daemon is connected, `PersistentPreRun` in main.go returns early without initializing the `store` variable\n2. Import/Export commands then tried to open the database directly with `sqlite.New(dbPath)` \n3. This blocked waiting for the database lock that the daemon already holds → **HANGS INDEFINITELY**\n\n## Solution Implemented\n\nModified both import.go and export.go to:\n1. Detect when `daemonClient` is connected\n2. Explicitly close the daemon connection before opening direct SQLite access\n3. Added debug logging to help diagnose similar issues\n\nThis ensures import/export commands always run in direct mode, avoiding lock contention.\n\n## File Path Handling\n\nThe file path confusion (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl) was a red herring. The code uses `filepath.Glob(\"*.jsonl\")` which correctly finds ANY `.jsonl` file in `.beads/` directory, so both filenames work.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-06T19:00:55.78797-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:07:15.077983-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-cbed9619.2 to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.974702-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.197709-07:00","source_repo":"."}

TestThreeCloneCollision demonstrates this with reproducible failures.\n\n## Root Causes Identified\n1. Pairwise resolution doesn't scale - each clone makes local decisions without global context\n2. DetectCollisions modifies state during detection (line 83-86 in collision.go)\n3. No remapping history - can't track transitive remap chains (test-1 → test-2 → test-3)\n4. Import-time resolution is too late - happens after git merge\n\n## Solution Architecture\nReplace pairwise resolution with deterministic global N-way resolution using:\n- Content-addressable identity (content hashing)\n- Global collision resolution (sort all versions by hash)\n- Read-only detection phase (separate from modification)\n- Idempotent imports (content-first matching)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes without skipping\n- All clones converge to identical content after final pull\n- No data loss (all issues present in all clones)\n- Works for N workers (test with 5+ clones)\n- Idempotent imports (importing same JSONL multiple times is safe)\n\n## Implementation Phases\nSee child issues for detailed breakdown of each phase.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.889079-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T11:59:41.031668-07:00","source_repo":"."}

On daemon start, attempt exclusive lock on .beads/bd.sock or .beads/daemon.lock\n2. If lock held by another process, refuse to start (exit with clear error)\n3. Hold lock for lifetime of daemon process\n4.

However, when BEADS_DB used a relative path (e.g., \".beads/beads.db\") from inside the .beads directory, FindDatabasePath() would resolve it to a nested path creating a separate workspace:\n- First daemon: /workspace/.beads/beads.db\n- Second daemon from .beads/: /workspace/.beads/.beads/beads.db ← Different lock file!\n\n## Testing\n\nAll acceptance criteria passed:\n✅ 1. Second daemon start fails with \"daemon already running\" error\n✅ 2. Killing daemon releases lock, new daemon can start  \n✅ 3. No infinite .beads/ recursion possible (tested nested BEADS_DB path)\n✅ 4.

Solution scales to arbitrary N\n2. Performance is acceptable with more clones\n3. Convergence time is bounded\n4. No edge cases in larger collision groups\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Create TestFiveCloneCollision\nFile: beads_twoclone_test.go (or new beads_nway_test.go)\n\n```go\nfunc TestFiveCloneCollision(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test with 5 clones creating same ID with different content\n    // Verify all 5 clones converge after sync rounds\n    \n    t.Run(\"SequentialSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"ReverseSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"E\", \"D\", \"C\", \"B\", \"A\")\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"RandomSync\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        testNCloneCollision(t, 5, \"C\", \"A\", \"E\", \"B\", \"D\")\n    })\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement generalized testNCloneCollision\nGeneralize the 3-clone test to handle arbitrary N:\n\n```go\nfunc testNCloneCollision(t *testing.T, numClones int, syncOrder ...string) {\n    t.Helper()\n    \n    if len(syncOrder) != numClones {\n        t.Fatalf(\"syncOrder length (%d) must match numClones (%d)\", \n            len(syncOrder), numClones)\n    }\n    \n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()\n    \n    // Setup remote and N clones\n    remoteDir := setupBareRepo(t, tmpDir)\n    cloneDirs := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        cloneDirs[name] = setupClone(t, tmpDir, remoteDir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Each clone creates issue with same ID but different content\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        createIssue(t, dir, fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name))\n    }\n    \n    // Sync in specified order\n    for _, name := range syncOrder {\n        syncClone(t, cloneDirs[name], name)\n    }\n    \n    // Final pull for convergence\n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        finalPull(t, dir, name)\n    }\n    \n    // Verify all clones have all N issues\n    expectedTitles := make(map[string]bool)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c numClones; i++ {\n        name := string(rune('A' + i))\n        expectedTitles[fmt.Sprintf(\"Issue from clone %s\", name)] = true\n    }\n    \n    for name, dir := range cloneDirs {\n        titles := getTitles(t, dir)\n        if !compareTitleSets(titles, expectedTitles) {\n            t.Errorf(\"Clone %s missing issues: expected %v, got %v\", \n                name, expectedTitles, titles)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    t.Log(\"✓ All\", numClones, \"clones converged successfully\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add performance benchmarks\nTest convergence time and memory usage:\n\n```go\nfunc BenchmarkNWayCollision(b *testing.B) {\n    for _, n := range []int{3, 5, 10, 20} {\n        b.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(b *testing.B) {\n            for i := 0; i \u003c b.N; i++ {\n                // Run N-way collision and measure time\n                testNCloneCollisionBench(b, n)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Add convergence time tests\nVerify bounded convergence:\n\n```go\nfunc TestConvergenceTime(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test that convergence happens within expected rounds\n    // For N clones, should converge in at most N-1 sync rounds\n    \n    for n := 3; n \u003c= 10; n++ {\n        t.Run(fmt.Sprintf(\"N=%d\", n), func(t *testing.T) {\n            rounds := measureConvergenceRounds(t, n)\n            maxExpected := n - 1\n            if rounds \u003e maxExpected {\n                t.Errorf(\"Convergence took %d rounds, expected ≤ %d\", \n                    rounds, maxExpected)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add edge case tests\nTest boundary conditions:\n- All N clones have identical content (dedup works)\n- N-1 clones have same content, 1 differs\n- All N clones have unique content\n- Mix of collisions and non-collisions\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- TestFiveCloneCollision passes with all sync orders\n- All 5 clones converge to identical content\n- Performance is acceptable (\u003c 5 seconds for 5 clones)\n- Convergence time is bounded (≤ N-1 rounds)\n- Edge cases handled correctly\n- Benchmarks show scalability to 10+ clones\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- beads_twoclone_test.go or beads_nway_test.go\n- Add helper functions for N-clone setup\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Test Matrix\n| N Clones | Sync Orders | Expected Result |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 3        | A→B→C       | Pass            |\n| 3        | C→B→A       | Pass            |\n| 5        | A→B→C→D→E   | Pass            |\n| 5        | E→D→C→B→A   | Pass            |\n| 5        | Random      | Pass            |\n| 10       | Sequential  | Pass            |\n\n### Performance Targets\n- 3 clones: \u003c 2 seconds\n- 5 clones: \u003c 5 seconds\n- 10 clones: \u003c 15 seconds\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5, bd-cbed9619.4, bd-cbed9619.3, bd-dcd6f14b to be completed\n- TestThreeCloneCollision must pass first\n\n## Success Metrics\n- All tests pass for N ∈ {3, 5, 10}\n- Convergence time scales linearly (O(N))\n- Memory usage reasonable (\u003c 100MB for 10 clones)\n- No data corruption or loss in any scenario","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T19:52:05.462747-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:00:43.198413-07:00","source_repo":"."}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","notes":"## Recovery Session (2025-10-29 21:30)\n\n### What Happened\n- Created 14 new hash ID issues (bd-f8b764c9 through bd-f8b764c9.1) \n- bd sync appeared to succeed\n- Canonical repo (~/src/beads): 162 issues in DB + JSONL ✓\n- Secondary repo (fred/beads): Only 145 issues vs 162 in canonical ✗\n- Both repos on same git commit but different issue counts!\n\n### Bug Manifestation During Recovery\n\n1. **Initial state**: fred/beads had 145 issues, 145 lines in JSONL, 145 export_hashes entries\n\n2. **After git reset --hard origin/main**: \n   - JSONL: 162 lines (from git)\n   - DB: 150 issues (auto-import partially worked)\n   - Auto-import failed with UNIQUE constraint error\n\n3. **After manual import --resolve-collisions**:\n   - DB: 160 issues\n   - JSONL: Still 162 lines\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries\n\n4. **After bd export**: \n   - **JSONL reduced to 17 lines!** ← The bug in action\n   - export_hashes: 159 entries (skipped exporting 142 issues)\n   - Silent data loss - no error message\n\n5. **After clearing export_hashes and re-export**:\n   - JSONL: 159 lines (missing 3 issues still)\n   - DB: 159 issues\n   - Still diverged from canonical\n\n### The Bug Loop\nOnce export_hashes and JSONL diverge:\n- Export skips issues already in export_hashes\n- But those issues aren't actually in JSONL\n- This creates corrupt JSONL with missing issues\n- Auto-import can't detect the problem (file hash matches what was exported)\n- Data is lost with no error messages\n\n### Recovery Solution\nCouldn't break the loop with export alone. Had to:\n1. Copy .beads/beads.db from canonical repo\n2. Clear export_hashes\n3. Full re-export\n4. Finally converged to 162 issues\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n1. **The bug is worse than we thought**: It can create corrupt exports (17 lines instead of 162!)\n\n2. **Auto-import can't save you**: Once export is corrupt, auto-import just imports the corrupt data\n\n3. **Silent failure**: No warnings, no errors, just missing issues\n\n4. **Git operations trigger it**: git reset, git pull, etc. change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n\n5. **Import operations populate export_hashes**: Even manual imports update export_hashes, setting up future export failures\n\n### Immediate Action Required\n\n**DISABLE EXPORT DEDUPLICATION NOW**\n\nThis feature is fundamentally broken and causes data loss. Should be disabled until properly fixed.\n\nQuick fix options:\n- Set environment variable to disable feature\n- Comment out shouldSkipExport check\n- Always clear export_hashes before export\n- Add validation that DB count == JSONL line count before allowing export\n\n### Long-term Fix\n\nNeed Option 2 + 4 from proposed solutions:\n1. Store JSONL file hash after every successful export\n2. Before export, verify JSONL hash matches expected\n3. If mismatch, log WARNING and clear export_hashes\n4. Clear export_hashes on every import operation\n5. Add git post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n6. Add `bd validate` command to detect divergence\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.959435-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.207148-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T21:57:03.06641-07:00","source_repo":"."}

Since beads is designed to be run by AI agents, we should leverage AI to make migrations safer.\n\n## Current State\n\nMigrations run blindly with:\n- No pre-flight validation\n- No data integrity verification\n- No rollback on failure\n- Limited post-migration testing\n\nRecent issues:\n- GH #201: Migration didn't set issue_prefix config, breaking commands\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive \"data loss\" warnings on collision resolution\n- Users reported migration data loss (fixed but broader problem remains)\n\n## Proposal: AI-Supervised Migration Framework\n\nUse AI to supervise migrations through structured verification:\n\n### 1. Pre-Migration Analysis\n- AI reads migration code and current schema\n- Identifies potential data loss scenarios\n- Generates validation queries to verify assumptions\n- Creates snapshot queries for before/after comparison\n\n### 2. Migration Execution\n- Take database backup/snapshot\n- Run validation queries (pre-state)\n- Execute migration in transaction\n- Run validation queries (post-state)\n\n### 3. Post-Migration Verification\n- AI compares pre/post snapshots\n- Verifies data integrity invariants\n- Checks for unexpected data loss\n- Validates config completeness (like issue_prefix)\n\n### 4. Rollback on Anomalies\n- If AI detects data loss, rollback transaction\n- Present human-readable error report\n- Suggest fix before retrying\n\n## Example Flow\n\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified 3 potential data loss scenarios\n→ Generating validation queries...\n→ Creating pre-migration snapshot...\n→ Running migration in transaction...\n→ Verifying post-migration state...\n✓ All 247 issues accounted for\n✓ Config table complete (issue_prefix: \"mcp\")\n✓ Dependencies intact (342 relationships verified)\n→ Migration successful!\n```\n\nIf something goes wrong:\n```\n$ bd migrate\n\n→ Analyzing migration plan...\n→ AI identified issue: Missing issue_prefix config after migration\n→ Recommendation: Add prefix detection step\n→ Aborting migration - database unchanged\n```\n\n## Implementation Ideas\n\n### A. Migration Validator Tool\nCreate `bd migrate --validate` that:\n- Simulates migration on copy of database\n- Uses AI to verify data integrity\n- Reports potential issues before real migration\n\n### B. Migration Test Generator\nAI generates test cases for migrations:\n- Edge cases (empty DB, large DB, missing config)\n- Data integrity checks\n- Regression tests\n\n### C. Migration Invariants\nDefine invariants that AI checks:\n- Issue count should not decrease (unless collision resolution)\n- All required config keys present\n- Foreign key relationships intact\n- No orphaned dependencies\n\n### D. Self-Healing Migrations\nAI detects incomplete migrations and suggests fixes:\n- Missing config values (like GH #201)\n- Orphaned data\n- Index inconsistencies\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Catch edge cases**: AI explores scenarios humans miss\n2. **Self-documenting**: AI explains what migration does\n3. **Agent-friendly**: Agents can run migrations confidently\n4. **Fewer rollbacks**: Detect issues before committing\n5. **Better testing**: AI generates comprehensive test suites\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Which AI model? (Fast: Haiku, Thorough: Sonnet/GPT-4)\n2. How to balance safety vs migration speed?\n3. Should AI validation be required or optional?\n4. How to handle offline scenarios (no API access)?\n5. What invariants should always be checked?\n\n## Related Work\n\n- bd-b245: Migration registry (makes migrations introspectable)\n- GH #201: issue_prefix migration bug (motivating example)\n- bd-d355a07d: False positive data loss warnings","design":"## Architecture: Agent-Supervised Migrations (Inversion of Control)\n\n**Key principle:** Beads provides observability and validation primitives. AI agents supervise using their own reasoning. Beads NEVER makes AI API calls.\n\n## Phase 1: Migration Invariants (Pure Validation)\n\nCreate `internal/storage/sqlite/migration_invariants.go`:\n\n```go\ntype MigrationInvariant struct {\n    Name        string\n    Description string\n    Check       func(*sql.DB, *Snapshot) error\n}\n\ntype Snapshot struct {\n    IssueCount      int\n    ConfigKeys      []string\n    DependencyCount int\n    LabelCount      int\n}\n\nvar invariants = []MigrationInvariant{\n    {\n        Name: \"required_config_present\",\n        Description: \"Required config keys must exist\",\n        Check: checkRequiredConfig, // Would have caught GH #201\n    },\n    {\n        Name: \"foreign_keys_valid\",\n        Description: \"No orphaned dependencies or labels\",\n        Check: checkForeignKeys,\n    },\n    {\n        Name: \"issue_count_stable\",\n        Description: \"Issue count should not decrease unexpectedly\",\n        Check: checkIssueCount,\n    },\n}\n\nfunc checkRequiredConfig(db *sql.DB, snapshot *Snapshot) error {\n    required := []string{\"issue_prefix\", \"schema_version\"}\n    for _, key := range required {\n        var value string\n        err := db.QueryRow(\"SELECT value FROM config WHERE key = ?\", key).Scan(\u0026value)\n        if err != nil || value == \"\" {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"required config key missing: %s\", key)\n        }\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Dry-Run \u0026 Inspection Tools\n\nAdd `bd migrate --dry-run --json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pending_migrations\": [\n    {\"name\": \"dirty_issues_table\", \"description\": \"Adds dirty_issues table\"},\n    {\"name\": \"content_hash_column\", \"description\": \"Adds content_hash for collision resolution\"}\n  ],\n  \"current_state\": {\n    \"schema_version\": \"0.9.9\",\n    \"issue_count\": 247,\n    \"config\": {\"schema_version\": \"0.9.9\"},\n    \"missing_config\": [\"issue_prefix\"]\n  },\n  \"warnings\": [\n    \"issue_prefix config not set - may break commands after migration\"\n  ],\n  \"invariants_to_check\": [\n    \"required_config_present\",\n    \"foreign_keys_valid\",\n    \"issue_count_stable\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAdd `bd info --schema --json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tables\": [\"issues\", \"dependencies\", \"labels\", \"config\"],\n  \"schema_version\": \"0.9.9\",\n  \"config\": {},\n  \"sample_issue_ids\": [\"mcp-1\", \"mcp-2\"],\n  \"detected_prefix\": \"mcp\"\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 3: Pre/Post Snapshots with Rollback\n\nUpdate `RunMigrations()`:\n\n```go\nfunc RunMigrations(db *sql.DB) error {\n    // Capture pre-migration snapshot\n    snapshot := captureSnapshot(db)\n    \n    // Run migrations in transaction\n    tx, err := db.Begin()\n    if err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    defer tx.Rollback()\n    \n    for _, migration := range migrations {\n        if err := migration.Func(tx); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"migration %s failed: %w\", migration.Name, err)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Verify invariants before commit\n    if err := verifyInvariants(tx, snapshot); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"post-migration validation failed (rolled back): %w\", err)\n    }\n    \n    return tx.Commit()\n}\n```\n\n## Phase 4: MCP Tools for Agent Supervision\n\nAdd to beads-mcp:\n\n```python\n@server.tool()\nasync def inspect_migration(workspace_root: str) -\u003e dict:\n    \"\"\"Get migration plan and current state for agent analysis.\n    \n    Agent should:\n    1.

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc, bd-81abb639","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267237-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.604643-07:00","source_repo":"."}

If they match, it skips export assuming the issue is already in the JSONL.\n\nThis assumption fails when:\n1. Git operations (pull, reset, checkout) change JSONL without clearing export_hashes\n2. Manual JSONL edits or corruption\n3. Import operations that modify DB but don't update export_hashes\n4. Partial exports that update export_hashes but don't complete\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss risk**: Issues appear to be tracked but aren't persisted to git\n- Breaks multi-repo sync (root cause of today's debugging session)\n- Auto-import fails to detect staleness (hash matches despite missing data)\n- Silent data corruption (no error messages, just missing issues)\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have DB with 149 issues, all in export_hashes table\n2. Truncate JSONL to 38 lines (simulate git reset or corruption)\n3. Run `bd export` - it skips 128 issues\n4. JSONL still has only 38 lines but export thinks it succeeded\n\n## Current Workaround\n\n```bash\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"DELETE FROM export_hashes\"\nbd export -o .beads/beads.jsonl\n```\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n**Option 1: Verify JSONL integrity before skipping**\n- Count lines in JSONL, compare with export_hashes count\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes and force full export\n- Safe but adds I/O overhead\n\n**Option 2: Hash-based JSONL validation**\n- Store hash of entire JSONL file in metadata\n- Before export, check if JSONL hash matches\n- If mismatch, clear export_hashes\n- More efficient, detects any JSONL corruption\n\n**Option 3: Disable timestamp-only deduplication**\n- Remove the feature entirely\n- Always export all issues\n- Simplest and safest, but creates larger git commits\n\n**Option 4: Clear export_hashes on git operations**\n- Add post-merge hook to clear export_hashes\n- Clear on any import operation\n- Defensive approach but may over-clear\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nCombination of Options 2 + 4:\n1. Store JSONL file hash in metadata after export\n2. Check hash before export, clear export_hashes if mismatch  \n3. Clear export_hashes on import operations\n4. Add `bd validate` check for JSONL/export_hashes sync\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- cmd/bd/autoflush.go (shouldSkipExport)\n- cmd/bd/export.go (export with deduplication)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/metadata.go (export_hashes table)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-29T23:05:13.960352-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.19679-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-29T22:22:20.406934-07:00","source_repo":"."}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-e6d71828, bd-7a2b58fc,-1","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:23:57.978339-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T01:49:23.457916-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T00:54:51.171319-08:00","source_repo":"."}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-0dcea000 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:02:47.952447-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-06T19:36:13.971527-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-06T19:27:29.41629-08:00","source_repo":"."}

This causes database routing issues for beads because:\n\n1. MCP server process starts with its own CWD (wherever it was launched from)\n2. `bd` binary uses tree-walking to discover databases based on CWD\n3. Without correct CWD, `bd` discovers the wrong database or falls back to ~/.beads\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nWe're using explicit `BEADS_DB` environment variables in MCP server configuration:\n- One MCP server per repo with explicit database path\n- Works but doesn't scale (30+ repos with .beads/ directories)\n\n## Desired Solution\n\nMCP server should receive CWD context either:\n\n### Option A: Startup Time\n- Claude Code/Amp passes working directory when launching MCP server\n- MCP server uses that directory for all tool calls\n- **Question:** Is this supported in MCP protocol/implementations?\n\n### Option B: Tool Call Time  \n- Each MCP tool call includes a `cwd` parameter\n- Tools use that CWD for subprocess execution\n- **Question:** Does MCP protocol support per-call context?\n\n### Option C: Hybrid\n- MCP server detects directory from Claude Code workspace/project\n- Tools accept optional `cwd` override parameter\n\n## Investigation Steps\n\n1. Review MCP protocol specification for context passing\n2. Check Claude Code MCP implementation for CWD handling\n3. Check Amp MCP implementation for CWD handling  \n4. Test if PWD environment variable is set correctly by Claude Code\n5. Prototype dynamic CWD detection in beads-mcp\n6. Document findings and recommend approach\n\n## References\n\n- beads-mcp already has `BEADS_WORKING_DIR` config support\n- bd_client.py uses `cwd` parameter for subprocess calls\n- Current implementation: `os.environ.get('PWD', os.getcwd())`\n","acceptance_criteria":"- Documented investigation findings\n- Tested CWD propagation in both Claude Code and Amp\n- Recommended approach for solving multi-repo MCP database routing\n- Prototype or proof-of-concept if feasible","notes":"## Implementation Complete (2025-10-17)\n\nImplemented PATH 1 (Simple Context Management) from the recommended solutions.\n\n### What Was Built\n\nAdded two new MCP tools to beads-mcp:\n\n1. **set_context(workspace_root)** - Sets workspace root and discovers database\n   - Resolves to git repo root automatically\n   - Walks up tree to find `.beads/*.db`\n   - Sets env vars: BEADS_WORKING_DIR, BEADS_DB, BEADS_CONTEXT_SET\n\n2. **where_am_i()** - Shows current context for debugging\n   - Returns workspace root, database path, actor\n\n3. **@require_context decorator** - Guards all write operations\n   - Only enforced when BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 env var is set\n   - Ensures context is set before create/update/close/reopen/dep/init\n   - Backward compatible (off by default)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- File: `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py`\n- Tests: All existing tests pass (103/104)\n- Documentation: `integrations/beads-mcp/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`\n\n### Key Discovery: Environment Variable Limitation\n\n**FastMCP architectural constraint:** Environment variables don't persist between tool calls in the current MCP protocol/FastMCP implementation.\n\nThis means:\n- `set_context` works within its own tool call\n- Subsequent tools may not see the env vars\n- True session state would require MCP protocol changes\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Partial solution delivered:**\n✅ Tools exist and work correctly\n✅ Can be used for explicit context management\n✅ Provides visibility (where_am_i)\n✅ Guards against accidental misrouting (when enabled)\n⚠️ Limited by MCP protocol's stateless nature\n\n**For production use:** Continue with current workaround (explicit BEADS_DB per MCP server config) until:\n1. MCP protocol adds session state support, OR\n2. We implement daemon RPC with per-request cwd (PATH 1.5), OR\n3. Client implementations can pass context with every tool call\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Immediate (keep current workaround):**\n- Use single MCP server with explicit BEADS_DB in config\n- Set BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 for safety\n- Call set_context at session start (even if env vars don't persist, it validates paths)\n\n**Medium-term (if needed):**\n- Implement PATH 1.5: Add cwd parameter to daemon RPC protocol\n- Update MCP server to use daemon client instead of direct CLI calls\n- Per-request context routing via daemon\n\n**Long-term (if \u003e50 repos):**\n- Implement PATH 2: Advanced routing daemon with repo→DB index\n\n## Original Notes\n[Previous investigation notes preserved above...]","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-17T02:06:09.737832-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-21T00:25:40.550071-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:54:35.196728-07:00","source_repo":"."}

The daemon silently fails for certain commands while appearing healthy.\n\nReproduction:\n1. Make local changes to issues (creates uncommitted .beads/beads.jsonl)\n2. Remote has updates (JSONL newer, triggers auto-import)\n3. Daemon tries to pull but fails: 'cannot pull with rebase: You have unstaged changes'\n4. Daemon enters bad state - 'bd show' and other commands return EOF\n5. 'bd list' still works, daemon process is running, no errors logged\n\nTechnical details:\n- Auto-import check runs in handleRequest() before processing RPC commands\n- When import is blocked, it appears to corrupt daemon state\n- Likely: deadlock, unclosed transaction, or storage handle corruption\n- Panic recovery (server_lifecycle_conn.go:183) didn't catch anything - not a panic\n\nRequired fix:\n- Auto-import must not block RPC command execution\n- Handle git pull failures gracefully without corrupting state\n- Consider: skip auto-import if git is dirty, queue import for later, or use separate goroutine\n- Add timeout/circuit breaker for import operations\n- Log clear warnings when auto-import is skipped\n\nWithout this fix, users in collaborative environments will frequently encounter mysterious EOF errors that require daemon restarts.","design":"Options to fix:\n\n1. Skip auto-import when git is dirty (safest, simplest)\n   - Check git status before pull\n   - Log warning and continue without import\n   - User must manually import after cleaning git state\n\n2. Async import with timeout (better UX)\n   - Run auto-import in background goroutine\n   - Don't block RPC command execution\n   - Timeout after 5s, log error if stuck\n   - Use sync.Once or similar to prevent concurrent imports\n\n3. Transactional import with rollback\n   - Wrap import in database transaction\n   - Rollback if git operations fail\n   - Ensure storage is never left in bad state\n\nRecommended: Combine #1 and #2\n- Check git status first, skip if dirty\n- If clean, do async import with timeout\n- Add metrics to track import success/failure rates","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181425-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949061-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-03T12:08:12.949064-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-8931","depends_on_id":"bd-1048","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-02T17:15:25.181857-08:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

UUID-Based IDs\nReplace sequential IDs with UUIDs:\n- Current: bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda, bd-4d80b7b1\n- CRDT: bd-a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\n- Human aliases maintained separately: #42 maps to UUID\n\n### 2. Last-Write-Wins (LWW) Elements\nEach field becomes an LWW register:\n- title: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- status: (timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- Deterministic conflict resolution via Lamport timestamp + clone_id tiebreaker\n\n### 3. Operation Log\nTrack all operations as CRDT ops:\n- CREATE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id, fields)\n- UPDATE(uuid, field, timestamp, clone_id, value)\n- DELETE(uuid, timestamp, clone_id) - tombstone, not hard delete\n\n### 4. Sync as Merge\nSyncing becomes merging two CRDT states:\n- No merge conflicts possible\n- Deterministic merge function\n- Guaranteed convergence\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Research \u0026 Design (4 weeks)\n- Study existing CRDT implementations (Automerge, Yjs, Loro)\n- Design schema for CRDT-based issue tracking\n- Prototype LWW-based Issue CRDT\n- Benchmark performance vs current system\n\n### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation (6 weeks)\n- Implement CRDT storage layer alongside SQLite\n- Build conversion tools: SQLite ↔ CRDT\n- Maintain backward compatibility with v1.x format\n- Migration path for existing databases\n\n### Phase 3: Testing \u0026 Validation (4 weeks)\n- Formal verification of convergence properties\n- Stress testing with 100+ clone scenario\n- Performance profiling and optimization\n- Documentation and examples\n\n### Phase 4: Migration \u0026 Rollout (4 weeks)\n- Release v2.0-beta with CRDT backend\n- Gradual migration from v1.x\n- Monitoring and bug fixes\n- Final v2.0 release\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n**Risk 1: Performance overhead**\n- Mitigation: Benchmark early, optimize hot paths\n- CRDTs can be slower than append-only logs\n- May need compaction strategy\n\n**Risk 2: Storage bloat**\n- Mitigation: Implement operation log compaction\n- Tombstone garbage collection for deleted issues\n- Periodic snapshots to reduce log size\n\n**Risk 3: Breaking changes**\n- Mitigation: Maintain v1.x compatibility layer\n- Gradual migration tools\n- Dual-mode operation during transition\n\n**Risk 4: Complexity**\n- Mitigation: Use battle-tested CRDT libraries\n- Comprehensive documentation\n- Clear migration guide\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 100-clone collision test passes without failures\n- Formal proof of convergence properties\n- Performance within 2x of current system\n- Zero manual conflict resolution required\n- Backward compatible with v1.x databases\n\n## Timeline\n18-20 weeks total (4-5 months)\n\n## References\n- Automerge: https://automerge.org\n- Yjs: https://docs.yjs.dev\n- Loro: https://loro.dev\n- CRDT theory: Shapiro et al, A comprehensive study of CRDTs\n- Related issues: bd-0dcea000, bd-4d7fca8a, bd-6221bdcd","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T20:48:00.267736-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T20:06:44.60536-07:00","source_repo":"."}

In N-way collision scenarios:\n- Clone B sees {test-1} locally, allocates test-2\n- Clone D sees {test-1, test-2, test-3} locally, allocates test-4\n- When same content gets assigned test-2 and test-4, convergence fails\n\nRoot cause: Each clone independently allocates IDs without global coordination, leading to overlapping assignments for the same content.\n\n## Solution\nAdd clone UUID to ID allocation to make every ID globally unique:\n\n**Current format:** `test-1`, `test-2`, `test-3`\n**New format:** `test-1-a7b3`, `test-2-a7b3`, `test-3-c4d9`\n\nWhere suffix is first 4 chars of clone UUID.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add clone_identity table\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE clone_identity (\n    clone_uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n### 2. Modify getNextIDForPrefix()\n```go\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) getNextIDForPrefix(ctx context.Context, prefix string) (string, error) {\n    cloneUUID := s.getOrCreateCloneUUID(ctx)\n    shortUUID := cloneUUID[:4]\n    \n    nextNum := s.getNextCounterForPrefix(ctx, prefix)\n    return fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d-%s\", prefix, nextNum, shortUUID), nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update ID parsing logic\nAll places that parse IDs (utils.ExtractIssueNumber, etc.) need to handle new format.\n\n### 4. Migration strategy\n- Existing IDs remain unchanged (no suffix)\n- New IDs get clone suffix automatically\n- Display layer can hide suffix in UI: `bd-cb64c226.3-a7b3` → `#42`\n\n## Benefits\n- **Zero collision risk**: Same content in different clones gets different IDs\n- **Maintains readability**: Still sequential numbering within clone\n- **No coordination needed**: Works offline, no central authority\n- **Scales to 100+ clones**: 4-char hex = 65,536 unique clones\n\n## Concerns\n- ID format change may break existing integrations\n- Need migration path for existing databases\n- Display logic needs update to hide/show suffixes appropriately\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 10+ clone collision test passes without failures\n- Existing issues continue to work (backward compatibility)\n- Documentation updated with new ID format\n- Migration guide for v1.x → v2.x\n\n## Timeline\nMedium-term (v1.1-v1.2), 2-3 weeks implementation\n\n## References\n- Related to bd-e6d71828 (immediate fix)\n- See beads_nway_test.go for failing N-way tests","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:52.260524-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-08T01:49:23.460028-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T00:36:58.134558-08:00","source_repo":"."}

This created an infinite loop:\n1. User runs `bd sync` which pulls and imports remote JSONL\n2. Sync unconditionally re-exports DB (which has local changes)\n3. JSONL becomes dirty immediately\n4. Repeat\n\n### Fix\nAdded `dbNeedsExport()` function in `integrity.go` that checks:\n- If JSONL exists\n- If DB modification time is newer than JSONL\n- If DB and JSONL issue counts match\n\nNow `bd sync` only re-exports if DB actually has changes that differ from JSONL.\n\n### Changes\n- Added `dbNeedsExport()` in `cmd/bd/integrity.go` (lines 228-271)\n- Updated `sync.go` lines 217-251 to check before re-exporting\n- Added comprehensive tests in `cmd/bd/sync_merge_test.go`\n\n### Testing\nAll tests pass including 4 new tests:\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_InSync` - Verifies no export when synced\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_DBNewer` - Detects DB modifications\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_CountMismatch` - Catches divergence\n- `TestDBNeedsExport_NoJSONL` - Handles missing JSONL\n\nThis prevents the weeks-long frustration of merge conflicts causing infinite dirty loops.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-05T17:52:14.776063-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-05T17:58:35.611942-08:00","source_repo":"."}

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:17:28.358028-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.179059-07:00","source_repo":"."}

This is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.","design":"## Implementation\n\nCreate `cmd/bd/setup.go` with subcommand `claude` that installs hooks via **JSON configuration** (Claude Code's native hook system).\n\n### Command Interface\n```bash\nbd setup claude              # Install globally (default)\nbd setup claude --project    # Install for this project only\nbd setup claude --check      # Verify installation\nbd setup claude --remove     # Remove bd hooks\n```\n\n### Claude Code Hook Architecture\n\n**Claude Code uses JSON configuration, NOT file discovery:**\n- Hooks defined in `settings.json` as arrays\n- Multiple tools coexist natively (parallel execution)\n- Configuration-based, not directory-based\n\n**Configuration files:**\n- Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`\n- Project: `./.claude/settings.json` or `./.claude/settings.local.json`\n\n### What Gets Installed\n\n**settings.json configuration only** (no script files needed):\n```json\n{\n  \"hooks\": {\n    \"SessionStart\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bd prime\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"PreCompact\": [\n      {\n        \"matcher\": \"\",\n        \"hooks\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"command\",\n            \"command\": \"bd prime\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Why no script files:**\n- `bd prime` is cross-platform (no shell syntax needed)\n- `bd prime` always exits 0 (no `|| true` needed)\n- `bd prime` never writes to stderr (no `2\u003e/dev/null` needed)\n- Simpler: one file to manage (settings.json), not two\n- More portable: no file permissions, no path dependencies\n\n### Installation Logic\n\n```go\nfunc

Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// buildHashMap creates a map of content hash → issue\nfunc buildHashMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// buildIDMap creates a map of ID → issue\nfunc buildIDMap(issues []*types.Issue) map[string]*types.Issue {\n    result := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        result[issue.ID] = issue\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\n// handleRename handles content match with different IDs\nfunc handleRename(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage, \n    existing *types.Issue, incoming *types.Issue) error {\n    \n    // Delete old ID\n    if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, existing.ID); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete old ID %s: %w\", existing.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Create with new ID\n    if err := s.CreateIssue(ctx, incoming, \"import-rename\"); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to create renamed issue %s: %w\", \n            incoming.ID, err)\n    }\n    \n    // Update references from old ID to new ID\n    idMapping := map[string]string{existing.ID: incoming.ID}\n    return updateReferences(ctx, s, idMapping)\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Add idempotency tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. Import same JSONL twice → second import reports all Unchanged\n2. Import, modify DB, import again → reports Updated\n3. Import with rename, import again → idempotent\n4. Import with collision resolution, import again → idempotent\n\n### 4. Update handleCollisions to use new flow\nCurrent handleCollisions in importer.go needs to be updated to:\n- Use content-first matching\n- Call new ResolveNWayCollisions\n- Apply results using ApplyCollisionResolution\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Import matches by content hash before checking IDs\n- Importing same JSONL multiple times is idempotent (reports Unchanged)\n- Rename detection works (same content, different ID)\n- ID conflicts resolved using global algorithm\n- Result.Unchanged correctly tracks idempotent imports\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes\n- All existing import tests still pass\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- buildHashMap correctly indexes by content hash\n- buildIDMap correctly indexes by ID\n- handleRename deletes old, creates new, updates references\n\n### Integration Tests\n- Import same data twice → idempotent\n- Import renamed issue → handled correctly\n- Import with collision → resolved globally\n- Final pull after 3-way collision → all clones converge\n\n### Property Tests\n- Idempotency: Import(x); Import(x) ≡ Import(x)\n- Commutativity: Import(a); Import(b) ≡ Import(b); Import(a) (for non-colliding issues)\n- Convergence: After N rounds of sync, all clones identical\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/importer/importer.go (major refactor of ImportIssues)\n- internal/importer/importer_test.go (new tests)\n- cmd/bd/import_bug_test.go (update for new behavior)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection)\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.3 (global resolution)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nMajor refactor of import logic. Recommend:\n1. Comprehensive tests before modifying\n2. Feature flag to enable/disable\n3. Keep old import code path for rollback\n4. Test with all existing import tests\n5. Manual testing with real repositories\n\n## Success Metrics\nAfter this phase:\n- TestThreeCloneCollision should PASS\n- All clones converge after final pull\n- Import is demonstrably idempotent\n- No data loss in N-way scenarios","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:38:25.671302-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-30T17:12:58.229134-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-28T20:21:39.529971-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-325da116","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:20.616846-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.360026-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.383624-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"bd-cbed9619.2","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-28T18:39:28.407157-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Returns mapping of old ID → new ID.\nfunc ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    collisions []*CollisionDetail, incoming []*types.Issue) (map[string]string, error) {\n    \n    if len(collisions) == 0 {\n        return make(map[string]string), nil\n    }\n    \n    // Group by base ID pattern (e.g., test-1, test-2 → base \"test-1\")\n    groups := groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions)\n    \n    idMapping := make(map[string]string)\n    \n    for baseID, versions := range groups {\n        // 1. Collect all unique versions by content hash\n        uniqueVersions := deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(versions)\n        \n        // 2. Sort by content hash (deterministic!)\n        sort.Slice(uniqueVersions, func(i, j int) bool {\n            return uniqueVersions[i].ContentHash \u003c uniqueVersions[j].ContentHash\n        })\n        \n        // 3. Assign sequential IDs based on sorted order\n        prefix := extractPrefix(baseID)\n        baseNum := extractNumber(baseID)\n        \n        for i, version := range uniqueVersions {\n            targetID := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%d\", prefix, baseNum+i)\n            \n            // Map this version to its deterministic ID\n            if version.ID != targetID {\n                idMapping[version.ID] = targetID\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return idMapping, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement helper functions\n\n```go\n// groupCollisionsByBaseID groups collisions by their logical base ID\nfunc groupCollisionsByBaseID(collisions []*CollisionDetail) map[string][]*types.Issue {\n    groups := make(map[string][]*types.Issue)\n    for _, c := range collisions {\n        baseID := c.ID  // All share same ID (that's why they collide)\n        groups[baseID] = append(groups[baseID], c.ExistingIssue, c.IncomingIssue)\n    }\n    return groups\n}\n\n// deduplicateVersionsByContentHash keeps one issue per unique content hash\nfunc deduplicateVersionsByContentHash(issues []*types.Issue) []*types.Issue {\n    seen := make(map[string]*types.Issue)\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if _, found := seen[issue.ContentHash]; !found {\n            seen[issue.ContentHash] = issue\n        }\n    }\n    result := make([]*types.Issue, 0, len(seen))\n    for _, issue := range seen {\n        result = append(result, issue)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update handleCollisions in importer\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go\n\nReplace ScoreCollisions call with:\n```go\n// OLD:\nif err := sqlite.ScoreCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult.Collisions, allExistingIssues); err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to score collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// NEW:\nidMapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, \n    collisionResult.Collisions, issues)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to resolve collisions: %w\", err)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update RemapCollisions\nRemapCollisions currently uses collision.RemapIncoming field. Update to use idMapping directly:\n- Remove RemapIncoming logic\n- Use idMapping to determine what to remap\n- Simplify to just apply the computed mapping\n\n### 5. Add comprehensive tests\n\nTest cases:\n1. 3-way collision with different content → 3 sequential IDs\n2. 3-way collision with 2 identical content → 2 IDs (dedupe works)\n3. Sync order independence (A→B→C vs C→A→B produce same result)\n4. Content hash ordering is respected\n5. Works with 5+ clones\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- ResolveNWayCollisions implemented and replaces ScoreCollisions\n- Groups all versions of same ID together\n- Deduplicates by content hash\n- Sorts by content hash deterministically\n- Assigns sequential IDs starting from base ID\n- Returns complete mapping (old ID → new ID)\n- All clones converge to same ID assignments\n- Works for arbitrary N-way collisions\n- TestThreeCloneCollision passes (or gets much closer)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (new function, helpers)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (call new function)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (comprehensive tests)\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n- groupCollisionsByBaseID correctly groups\n- deduplicateVersionsByContentHash removes duplicates\n- Sorting by hash is stable and deterministic\n- Sequential ID assignment is correct\n\n### Integration Tests\n- 3-way collision resolves to 3 issues\n- Sync order doesn't affect final IDs\n- Content hash ordering determines winner\n\n### Property Tests\n- For any N clones with same content, all converge to same IDs\n- Idempotent: running resolution twice produces same result\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.5 (ContentHash field) to be completed first\n- Requires bd-cbed9619.4 (read-only detection) for clean integration\n\n## Notes\nThis is the core algorithm that enables convergence.

Move all modifications to a separate ApplyCollisionResolution function.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1.

Create ApplyCollisionResolution function\nNew function to apply all modifications atomically:\n```go\nfunc ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx context.Context, s *SQLiteStorage,\n    result *CollisionResult, mapping map[string]string) error {\n    \n    // Phase 1: Handle renames (delete old IDs)\n    for _, rename := range result.Renames {\n        if err := s.DeleteIssue(ctx, rename.OldID); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to delete renamed issue %s: %w\", \n                rename.OldID, err)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Phase 2: Create new IDs (from mapping)\n    // Phase 3: Update references\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update callers to use two-phase approach\nFile: internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions)\n```go\n// Phase 1: Detect (read-only)\ncollisionResult, err := sqlite.DetectCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, issues)\n\n// Phase 2: Resolve (compute mapping)\nmapping, err := sqlite.ResolveNWayCollisions(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult)\n\n// Phase 3: Apply (modify DB)\nerr = sqlite.ApplyCollisionResolution(ctx, sqliteStore, collisionResult, mapping)\n```\n\n### 5. Update tests\n- Verify DetectCollisions doesn't modify DB\n- Test ApplyCollisionResolution separately\n- Add test for rename detection without modification\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- DetectCollisions performs zero writes to database\n- DetectCollisions returns RenameDetail entries for content matches\n- ApplyCollisionResolution handles all modifications\n- All existing tests still pass\n- New test verifies read-only detection\n- contentToDBIssue map stays consistent throughout detection\n\n## Files to Modify\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go (DetectCollisions, new function)\n- internal/importer/importer.go (handleCollisions caller)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/collision_test.go (add tests)\n\n## Testing\n- Unit test: DetectCollisions with content match doesn't delete DB issue\n- Unit test: RenameDetail correctly populated\n- Unit test: ApplyCollisionResolution applies renames\n- Integration test: Full flow still works end-to-end\n\n## Risk Mitigation\nThis is a significant refactor of core collision logic.

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3. Ensure dependencies are preserved on the correct remapped issue\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- All three autoimport tests pass\n- Tests verify content-hash determinism (same collision always resolves the same way)\n- Tests check dependency preservation on remapped issues\n- Test documentation explains content-hash scoring expectations\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `cmd/bd/autoimport_collision_test.go`\n\n## Testing\nRun: `go test ./cmd/bd -run \"TestAutoImport.*Collision\" -v`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-20T12:17:55.846346-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-20T12:17:55.846346-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-08T22:42:08.862831-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-dd6f6d26","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.4","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-10-28T19:12:56.345276-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Update text references\n\nFailure at step 2 leaves database in inconsistent state.\n\n## Solution\nWrap collision resolution in database transaction with retry logic:\n- Make entire RemapCollisions operation atomic\n- Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\n- Re-sync counters between retries\n- Add better error messages for debugging\n\n## Implementation\nLocation: internal/storage/sqlite/collision.go:342 (RemapCollisions function)\n\n```go\n// Retry up to 3 times on UNIQUE constraint failures\nfor attempt := 0; attempt \u003c 3; attempt++ {\n    err := s.db.ExecInTransaction(func(tx *sql.Tx) error {\n        // All collision resolution operations\n    })\n    if !isUniqueConstraintError(err) {\n        return err\n    }\n    s.SyncAllCounters(ctx)\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- 5-clone collision test passes reliably\n- No partial state on UNIQUE constraint errors\n- Automatic recovery from transient ID conflicts\n\n## References\n- See beads_nway_test.go:124 for the KNOWN LIMITATION comment\n- Related to-7c5915ae (transaction support)","notes":"## Progress Made\n\n1. Added `ExecInTransaction` helper to SQLiteStorage for atomic database operations\n2. Added `IsUniqueConstraintError` function to detect UNIQUE constraint violations\n3. Wrapped `RemapCollisions` with retry logic (up to 3 attempts) with counter sync between retries\n4. Enhanced `handleRename` to detect and handle race conditions where target ID already exists\n5. Added defensive checks for when old ID has been deleted by another clone\n\n## Test Results\n\nThe changes improve N-way collision handling but don't fully solve the problem:\n- Original error: `UNIQUE constraint failed: issues.id` during first convergence round\n- With changes: Test proceeds further but encounters different collision scenarios\n- New error: `target ID already exists with different content` in later convergence rounds\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue is more complex than initially thought. In N-way scenarios:\n1. Clone A remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-2 → test-4\n2. Clone B remaps bd-1c63eb84 → test-3 → test-4  \n3. Both try to create test-4, but with different intermediate states\n4. This creates legitimate content collisions that require additional resolution\n\n## Next Steps  \n\nThe full solution requires:\n1. Making remapping fully deterministic across clones (same input → same remapped ID)\n2. OR making `handleRename` more tolerant of mid-flight collisions\n3. OR implementing full transaction support for multi-step collision resolution -7c5915ae)\n\nThe retry logic added here provides a foundation but isn't sufficient for complex N-way scenarios.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:22:32.716678-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-02T16:46:45.864479-08:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-e6d71828","depends_on_id":"bd-cbed9619.1","type":"related","created_at":"2025-10-29T10:44:44.14653-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

AGENTS.md\nUpdate agent workflow:\n```markdown\n## Hash-Based IDs (v2.0+)\n\nBeads v2.0 uses hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems:\n\n**When creating issues**:\n```bash\nbd create \"Fix bug\" -p 1\n# → Creates bd-af78e9a2 with alias #1\n```\n\n**When referencing issues**:\n- In text: Use hash IDs (stable): \"See bd-af78e9a2 for details\"\n- In CLI: Use aliases (readable): `bd update #42 --status done`\n\n**After sync**:\n- Alias conflicts resolved automatically (content-hash ordering)\n- No ID collisions possible\n- No remapping needed\n\n**Migration from v1.x**:\n```bash\nbd migrate --hash-ids  # One-time migration\n```\n```\n\n### 3. QUICKSTART.md (if exists)\nShow alias usage in examples:\n```bash\n# Create issue (gets hash ID + alias)\nbd create \"Fix authentication bug\" -p 1\n# → Created bd-af78e9a2 (alias: #1)\n\n# Reference by alias\nbd show #1\nbd update #1 --status in_progress\nbd close #1 --reason \"Fixed\"\n```\n\n### 4. ADVANCED.md\nAdd section on hash ID internals:\n```markdown\n## Hash ID Generation\n\nHash IDs are generated deterministically:\n\n```go\nSHA256(title || description || timestamp || workspace_id)[:8]\n```\n\n**Collision probability**:\n- 8 hex chars = 2^32 space = ~4 billion IDs\n- Birthday paradox: 50% collision probability at ~65,000 issues\n- For typical projects (\u003c10,000 issues), collision risk is negligible\n\n**Collision detection**:\nIf a hash collision occurs (extremely rare), beads:\n1. Detects on insert (UNIQUE constraint)\n2. Appends random suffix: `bd-af78e9a2-a1b2`\n3. Retries insert\n\n## Alias Conflict Resolution\n\nWhen multiple clones assign same alias to different issues:\n\n**Strategy**: Content-hash ordering (deterministic)\n- Sort conflicting issue IDs lexicographically\n- Lowest hash ID keeps the alias\n- Others reassigned to next available aliases\n\n**Example**:\n```\nClone A: Assigns #42 to bd-a1b2c3d4\nClone B: Assigns #42 to bd-e5f6a7b8\nAfter sync: bd-a1b2c3d4 keeps #42 (lower hash)\n            bd-e5f6a7b8 gets #100 (next available)\n```\n```\n\n### 5. MIGRATION.md (new file)\n```markdown\n# Migrating to Hash-Based IDs (v2.0)\n\n## Overview\nBeads v2.0 introduces hash-based IDs to eliminate collision problems. This is a **breaking change** requiring migration.\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Backup\n```bash\ncp -r .beads .beads.backup\ngit commit -am \"Pre-migration backup\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run Migration\n```bash\n# Dry run first\nbd migrate --hash-ids --dry-run\n\n# Apply migration\nbd migrate --hash-ids\n```\n\n### 3. Commit Changes\n```bash\ngit add .beads/issues.jsonl\ngit commit -m \"Migrate to hash-based IDs (v2.0)\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 4. Coordinate with Collaborators\nAll clones must migrate before syncing:\n1. Notify team: \"Migrating to v2.0 on [date]\"\n2. All collaborators pull latest\n3. All run `bd migrate --hash-ids`\n4. All push changes\n5. Resume normal work\n\n## Rollback\n```bash\n# Restore backup\nmv .beads.backup .beads\nbd export  # Regenerate JSONL\ngit checkout .beads/issues.jsonl\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: Can I mix v1.x and v2.0 clones?**\nA: No. All clones must be on same version.\n\n**Q: Will my old issue IDs work?**\nA: No, but aliases preserve the numbers: bd-1c63eb84 → #1\n\n**Q: What happens to links like \"see bd-cb64c226.3\"?**\nA: Migration updates all text references automatically.\n```\n\n### 6. CHANGELOG.md\n```markdown\n## v2.0.0 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **Hash-based IDs**: Issues now use collision-free hash IDs (bd-af78e9a2)\n  instead of sequential IDs (bd-1c63eb84, bd-9063acda)\n- **Aliasing system**: Human-friendly aliases (#42) for hash IDs\n- **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate --hash-ids` to convert v1.x databases\n\n### Added\n- `bd alias` command for manual alias control\n- `bd migrate --hash-ids` migration tool\n- Alias conflict resolution (deterministic, content-hash ordering)\n\n### Removed\n- ID collision detection and resolution (~2,100 LOC)\n- `bd import --resolve-collisions` flag (no longer needed)\n\n### Benefits\n- ✅ Zero ID collisions in distributed workflows\n- ✅ Simpler codebase (-1,350 net LOC)\n- ✅ Better git merge behavior\n- ✅ True offline-first operation\n```\n\n## Testing\n- Build docs locally (if using doc generator)\n- Check all links work\n- Verify examples are correct\n- Spellcheck\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n- README.md (hash ID section)\n- AGENTS.md (workflow updates)\n- ADVANCED.md (internals)\n- MIGRATION.md (new)\n- CHANGELOG.md (v2.0 entry)\n- docs/ (any other docs)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.979971-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.611114-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981344-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.981767-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.12","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.13","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:10.982167-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

MCP Function Signatures (No Change)\nFunctions already use issue IDs as strings, so they work with hash IDs:\n\n```python\n# These already work!\nbeads_show(issue_id: str)           # Accepts bd-af78e9a2 or #42\nbeads_update(issue_id: str, ...)    # Accepts both formats\nbeads_close(issue_ids: List[str])   # Accepts both formats\n```\n\n### 2. Add Alias Resolution Helper\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n\n```python\ndef resolve_issue_id(issue_id: str) -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Resolve alias to hash ID if needed.\"\"\"\n    # Hash ID: pass through\n    if issue_id.startswith('bd-') and len(issue_id) == 11:\n        return issue_id\n    \n    # Alias: #42 or 42\n    alias_str = issue_id.lstrip('#')\n    try:\n        alias = int(alias_str)\n        # Call bd to resolve\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['bd', 'alias', 'find', f'bd-{alias}'],\n            capture_output=True, text=True\n        )\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            return result.stdout.strip()\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Invalid format\n    raise ValueError(f\"Invalid issue ID: {issue_id}\")\n```\n\n### 3.

Update beads-mcp: `pip install --upgrade beads-mcp`\n2. Restart MCP server\n3. All existing workflows continue to work\n```\n\n### 6. Version Compatibility\nDetect and handle both v1.x and v2.0 formats:\n\n```python\ndef detect_beads_version() -\u003e str:\n    \"\"\"Detect if beads is using sequential or hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    result = subprocess.run(['bd', 'list', '-n', '1'], ...)\n    first_id = parse_first_issue_id(result.stdout)\n    \n    if first_id.startswith('bd-') and len(first_id) \u003e 11:\n        return '2.0'  # Hash ID\n    else:\n        return '1.x'  # Sequential ID\n\n# On startup\nbeads_version = detect_beads_version()\nlogger.info(f\"Detected beads version: {beads_version}\")\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Unit Tests\nFile: integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py\n\n```python\ndef test_resolve_hash_id():\n    \"\"\"Hash IDs pass through unchanged.\"\"\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"bd-af78e9a2\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_resolve_alias():\n    \"\"\"Aliases resolve to hash IDs.\"\"\"\n    # Mock bd alias find command\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"#42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n    assert resolve_issue_id(\"42\") == \"bd-af78e9a2\"\n\ndef test_invalid_id():\n    \"\"\"Invalid IDs raise ValueError.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n        resolve_issue_id(\"invalid\")\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n```python\nasync def test_show_with_hash_id(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"bd-af78e9a2\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text\n\nasync def test_show_with_alias(mcp_server):\n    result = await mcp_server.beads_show(issue_id=\"#42\")\n    assert \"bd-af78e9a2\" in result[0].text  # Resolved\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\nThe MCP server should work with both:\n- Beads v1.x (sequential IDs)\n- Beads v2.0+ (hash IDs)\n\nDetection happens at runtime based on issue ID format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py\n- integrations/beads-mcp/README.md\n- integrations/beads-mcp/tests/test_hash_ids.py (new)\n- integrations/beads-mcp/pyproject.toml (bump version)\n\n## Deployment\n```bash\ncd integrations/beads-mcp\n# Bump version to 2.0.0\npoetry version 2.0.0\n# Publish to PyPI\npoetry publish --build\n```","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.256074-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-31T12:32:32.60786-07:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.257315-07:00","created_by":"stevey"},{"issue_id":"bd-f8b764c9.2","depends_on_id":"bd-f8b764c9.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-10-29T21:28:45.258057-07:00","created_by":"stevey"}]}

Agent A created 4 new issues and exported to issues.jsonl (commit 99a9d58)\n2. Agent A closed an issue and exported again (commit 58b4613) - JSONL now has 4 epics\n3. Agent B had stale database (from before step 1)\n4. Agent B worked on unrelated issue and exported (commit 0609233)\n5. Agent B's export **overwrote issues.jsonl**, removing the 4 epics created by Agent A\n6. Required manual recovery by re-exporting from Agent A's correct database\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n`bd export` should detect that the database is stale and either:\n- **Refuse to export** with error message explaining the issue\n- **Warn prominently** and require explicit --force flag to override\n- **Auto-import first** to sync database before exporting\n\n## How to Detect Staleness\n\nCompare modification times (similar to VC's ValidateDatabaseFreshness):\n1. Check .db, .db-wal, .db-shm timestamps (use newest for WAL mode)\n2. Check issues.jsonl timestamp\n3. If JSONL is newer by \u003e1 second: database is stale\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd staleness check in `bd export`:\n\n```go\nfunc Export(dbPath, jsonlPath string, force bool) error {\n    // Check if database is stale\n    if !force {\n        if err := checkDatabaseFreshness(dbPath, jsonlPath); err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"database is stale: %w\\n\" +\n                \"Run 'bd import %s' first to sync, or use --force to override\",\n                err, jsonlPath)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Proceed with export...\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity**: High (silent data loss)\n- **Frequency**: Happens in multi-agent workflows when agents don't sync\n- **Workaround**: Manual recovery (re-export from correct database)\n\n## References\n\n- VC issue tracker: commits 58b4613 -\u003e 0609233 -\u003e c41c638\n- VC has similar check: `storage.ValidateDatabaseFreshness()`\n- Tolerance: 1 second (handles filesystem timestamp precision)","acceptance_criteria":"1. bd export detects stale database (JSONL newer than DB)\n2.

Works correctly with WAL mode (.db-wal files)\n7. Test coverage for staleness detection\n8. Documentation updated with export safety warnings","notes":"Fixed with ID-based comparison instead of just count. Now detects:\n1. DB has fewer issues than JSONL (count check)\n2. DB has different issues than JSONL (ID comparison)\n\nBoth scenarios now properly refuse export unless --force is used.\n\nImplementation uses getIssueIDsFromJSONL() to build a set of IDs from JSONL, then checks if any JSONL IDs are missing from DB.

Every token in context has real costs:\n\n### Compute Cost\n- **Processing overhead**: Larger context = more GPU/CPU cycles per request\n- **Memory usage**: 10.5k tokens consume significant RAM/VRAM\n- **Scaling impact**: Multiplied across all users, all sessions, all requests\n\n### Energy \u0026 Environment\n- **Electricity**: More compute = more power consumption\n- **Carbon footprint**: Data centers running on grid power (not all renewable)\n- **Sustainability**: Unnecessary token usage contributes to AI's environmental impact\n- **Responsibility**: Efficient tools are better for the planet\n\n### User Experience\n- **Latency**: Larger context = slower processing (noticeable at 10k+ tokens)\n- **Cost**: Many AI services charge per token (input + output)\n- **Rate limits**: Context counts against API quotas\n\n### Engineering Excellence\n- **Efficiency**: Good engineering minimizes resource usage\n- **Scalability**: Efficient tools scale better\n- **Best practices**: Optimize for the common case\n\n**The comparison:**\n\n| Approach | Standing Context | Efficiency | User Cost | Environmental Impact |\n|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **CLI + hooks** | ~1-2k tokens | 80-90% reduction | Lower | Sustainable ✓ |\n| **MCP minimal** | ~2-4k tokens | 60-80% reduction | Medium | Better ✓ |\n| **MCP full** | ~10.5k tokens | Baseline | Higher | Wasteful ✗ |\n\n**Functional equivalence:**\n- CLI via Bash tool works just as well as MCP native calls\n- Same features, same reliability\n- No downside except initial learning curve\n\n## Hybrid Mode: Minimal MCP Surface Area\n\n**Philosophy:** MCP server doesn't have to expose everything.\n\nIf certain commands have legitimate UX/DX benefits from MCP (e.g., no approval prompts, cleaner syntax), we can expose ONLY those commands via MCP while using CLI for everything else.\n\n### Potential MCP-Only Candidates (TBD)\n\nCommands that might benefit from MCP native calls:\n- `ready` - frequently checked, no side effects, approval prompt annoying\n- `show` - read-only, frequently used, approval slows workflow\n- `list` - read-only, no risk, approval adds friction\n\nCommands that work fine via CLI:\n- `create` - complex parameters, benefits from explicit confirmation\n- `update` - state changes, good to see command explicitly\n- `close` - state changes, explicit is better\n- `dep` - relationships, good to see what's being linked\n- `sync` - git operations, definitely want visibility\n\n### Token Budget\n\n**Full MCP** (current): ~10.5k tokens\n- All ~20+ bd commands exposed\n- All parameter schemas\n- All descriptions and examples\n\n**Minimal MCP** (proposed): ~2-4k tokens\n- 3-5 high-frequency read commands only\n- Simplified schemas\n- Minimal descriptions\n- Everything else via CLI\n\n**Pure CLI**: ~1-2k tokens (only on SessionStart/PreCompact)\n- No MCP tools loaded\n- All commands via Bash\n\n### Investigation Required\n\nBefore implementing hybrid mode, validate:\n\n1. **Do MCP calls actually skip approval prompts?**\n   - Test with Claude Code approval settings\n   - Compare MCP tool calls vs Bash tool calls\n   - Measure UX difference in real usage\n\n2. **What's the actual token breakdown per command?**\n   - Measure individual command schemas\n   - Calculate token savings for minimal vs full\n\n3. **Is approval prompt the only benefit?**\n   - Are there other UX advantages to MCP?\n   - Does native syntax actually improve experience?\n   - User testing with both approaches\n\n4. **Can we dynamically load MCP tools?**\n   - Only load MCP when certain commands needed?\n   - Hot-swap between CLI and MCP?\n   - Probably not - MCP loads at startup\n\n### Hybrid Mode Documentation (If Validated)\n\n```markdown\n## Choosing Your Integration Approach\n\nBeads supports three AI agent integration approaches:\n\n### CLI + Hooks (Recommended - Most Efficient)\n\n**Setup:** `bd setup claude`\n\nUses Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context via `bd prime` command. Agent uses bd via Bash tool.\n\n**Tokens:** ~1-2k (on SessionStart/PreCompact only)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Maximum efficiency (80-90% reduction vs full MCP)\n- Lowest compute/energy usage\n- Same functionality as MCP\n\n**Cons:**\n- Bash tool calls may require approval prompts\n- Slightly more verbose in conversation\n\n### Minimal MCP + Hooks (Balanced)\n\n**Setup:** Install minimal MCP server (read-only commands) + `bd setup claude`\n\nExposes only high-frequency read commands via MCP (ready, show, list). Everything else via CLI.\n\n**Tokens:** ~2-4k MCP + ~1-2k hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- 60-80% reduction vs full MCP\n- No approval prompts for common queries\n- Cleaner syntax for frequent operations\n- Still efficient\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires MCP server (additional setup)\n- Mixed interface (some MCP, some CLI)\n\n### Full MCP + Hooks (Legacy)\n\n**Setup:** Install full MCP server + `bd setup claude`\n\n**Tokens:** ~10.5k MCP + hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- All commands as native function calls\n- Consistent interface\n\n**Cons:**\n- Highest token usage (worst for compute/energy/cost)\n- Slowest processing\n- Less sustainable\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. **Start with CLI + hooks** - most efficient, works great\n2. **Try minimal MCP** if approval prompts become annoying\n3. **Avoid full MCP** - wasteful with no significant benefit\n```\n\n## Production Validation Checklist\n\nBefore making these documentation changes, validate CLI approach works reliably:\n\n### Phase 1: Pure CLI Validation\n- [ ] `bd prime` implemented and tested\n- [ ] Hooks installed and working in Claude Code\n- [ ] Real-world usage by at least 2-3 developers for 1+ weeks\n- [ ] No significant usability issues reported\n- [ ] Agent successfully uses bd via Bash tool\n- [ ] Document which commands (if any) have approval prompt issues\n\n### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode Investigation (Optional)\n- [ ] Test if MCP calls skip approval prompts vs Bash calls\n- [ ] Measure token cost per MCP command\n- [ ] Identify minimal set of commands worth exposing via MCP\n- [ ] Build minimal MCP server variant\n- [ ] Validate token savings (should be 60-80% vs full MCP)\n- [ ] User testing shows actual UX improvement\n\n### Phase 3: Documentation Update\n- [ ] Update based on validation results\n- [ ] Include measured token counts (not estimates)\n- [ ] Provide clear migration paths\n- [ ] Update `bd doctor` recommendations\n\n## Migration Guide (Optional)\n\nFor users currently using MCP:\n\n```markdown\n### Migrating from Full MCP to CLI + Hooks\n\nAlready using full MCP server? You can switch to the more efficient CLI approach:\n\n1. Install hooks: `bd setup claude`\n2. Test it works (hooks inject context, agent uses Bash tool)\n3. Remove MCP server from `~/.claude/settings.json`\n4. Restart Claude Code\n\nYou'll get the same functionality with 80-90% less token usage.\n\n### Migrating to Minimal MCP (If Available)\n\nIf you find approval prompts annoying for certain commands:\n\n1. Replace full MCP with minimal MCP in `~/.claude/settings.json`\n2. Restart Claude Code\n3. Verify high-frequency commands (ready, show, list) work via MCP\n4. Everything else automatically uses CLI\n\nYou'll get 60-80% token reduction vs full MCP while keeping the UX benefits.\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `README.md` - Add recommendation in AI Integration section\n- `AGENTS.md` - Add \"Choosing Your Integration Approach\" section early\n- `QUICKSTART.md` - Update AI integration section\n- `docs/` - Any other AI integration docs if they exist\n- `mcp-server/` - Create minimal variant if hybrid validated\n\n## Future: Update `bd init`\n\nOnce validated, update `bd init` to:\n- Default to recommending `bd setup claude` (hooks only)\n- Mention minimal MCP as option for UX improvement\n- Detect existing full MCP and suggest migration\n- Provide token usage estimates for each approach\n\n## MCP Server Architecture Note\n\n**Key insight:** MCP server doesn't have to expose all bd functionality.\n\nCurrent design exposes ~20+ commands (all bd subcommands). This is over-engineered.\n\n**Better design:**\n- **Minimal MCP**: 3-5 read-only commands (~2-4k tokens)\n- **CLI**: Everything else via Bash tool\n- **Hooks**: Context injection via `bd prime`\n\nThis achieves best of both worlds:\n- Low token usage (efficient)\n- No approval prompts for common queries (UX)\n- Explicit visibility for state changes (safety)\n\nIf validation shows NO meaningful benefit to MCP (even minimal), skip hybrid mode entirely and recommend pure CLI.","acceptance_criteria":"- Documentation explains CLI + hooks as recommended approach\n- Explains why context size matters (compute/energy/cost/latency)\n- Token comparison table shows 80-90% reduction\n- Migration guide for existing MCP users\n- Only deployed AFTER production validation\n- Clear that both approaches are supported","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-12T00:15:25.923025-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-12T00:18:16.786857-08:00","source_repo":"."}
