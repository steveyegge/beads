{"id":"bd-drxs","title":"Make merge requests ephemeral wisps instead of permanent issues","description":"## Problem\n\nMerge requests (MRs) are currently created as regular beads issues (type: merge-request). This means they:\n- Sync to JSONL and propagate via git\n- Accumulate in the issue database indefinitely\n- Clutter `bd list` output with closed MRs\n- Create permanent records for inherently transient artifacts\n\nMRs are process artifacts, not work products. They exist briefly while code awaits merge, then their purpose is fulfilled. The git merge commit and GitHub PR (if applicable) provide the permanent audit trail - the beads MR is redundant.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nMake MRs ephemeral wisps that exist only during the merge process:\n\n1. **Create MRs as wisps**: When a polecat completes work and requests merge, create the MR in `.beads-wisp/` instead of `.beads/`\n\n2. **Refinery visibility**: This works because all clones within a rig share the same database:\n   ```\n   beads/              ← Rig root\n   ├── .beads/         ← Permanent issues (synced to JSONL)\n   ├── .beads-wisp/    ← Ephemeral wisps (NOT synced)\n   ├── crew/dave/      ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ├── polecats/*/     ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   └── refinery/       ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ```\n   The refinery can see wisp MRs immediately - same SQLite database.\n\n3. **On merge completion**: Burn the wisp (delete without digest). The git merge commit IS the permanent record. No digest needed since:\n   - Digest wouldn't be smaller than the MR itself (~200-300 bytes either way)\n   - Git history provides complete audit trail\n   - GitHub PR (if used) provides discussion/approval record\n\n4. **On merge rejection/abandonment**: Burn the wisp. Optionally notify the source polecat via mail.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Clean JSONL**: MRs never pollute the permanent issue history\n- **No accumulation**: Wisps are burned on completion, no cleanup needed\n- **Correct semantics**: Wisps are for \"operational ephemera\" - MRs fit perfectly\n- **Reduced sync churn**: Fewer JSONL updates, faster `bd sync`\n- **Cleaner queries**: `bd list` shows work items, not process artifacts\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Where MRs are created\n\nCurrently MRs are created by the witness or polecat when work is ready for merge. This code needs to:\n- Set `wisp: true` on the MR issue\n- Or use a dedicated wisp creation path\n\n### Refinery changes\n\nThe refinery queries for pending MRs to process. It needs to:\n- Query wisp storage as well as (or instead of) permanent storage\n- Use `bd mol burn` or equivalent to delete processed MRs\n\n### What about cross-rig MRs?\n\nIf an MR needs to be visible outside the rig (e.g., external collaborators):\n- They would see the GitHub PR anyway\n- Or we could create a permanent \"merge completed\" notification issue\n- But this is likely unnecessary - MRs are internal coordination\n\n### Migration\n\nExisting MRs in permanent storage:\n- Can be cleaned up with `bd cleanup` or manual deletion\n- Or left to age out naturally\n- No migration of open MRs needed (they'll complete under old system\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Auto-cleanup of closed MRs**: Keep MRs as permanent issues but auto-delete after 24h. Simpler but still creates sync churn and temporary JSONL pollution.\n\n2. **MRs as mail only**: Polecat sends mail to refinery with merge details, no MR issue at all.

{"id":"bd-f2f","title":"CRITICAL: bd sync exports before pull, allowing stale DB to corrupt JSONL statuses","description":"## Root Cause\n\nThe fix in bd-53c (reverse ZFC check) only checks COUNTS, not content. The real corruption happens when:\n\n1. Polecat A has stale DB with old status values (e.g., status=closed for issues that are now open on remote)\n2. Polecat A runs bd sync:\n   - **Export FIRST**: DB (status=closed) → JSONL (overwrites correct status=open)\n   - Commit: Stale JSONL committed\n   - Pull: 3-way merge with remote\n   - Merge uses 'closed wins' rule → status stays closed\n3. Polecat A pushes → Remote now corrupted with status=closed\n\n## Why bd-53c didn't fix it\n\nThe reverse ZFC check compares COUNTS:\n```go\nif jsonlCount \u003e dbCount  // Only catches count mismatch\n```\n\nBut in the corruption scenario:\n- JSONL count = 5, DB count = 5 (same count!)\n- Only the STATUS field differs\n\n## The Real Fix\n\n**PULL BEFORE EXPORT**. The sync order must be:\n1. Pull from remote (get latest state)\n2. Import merged JSONL to DB\n3. THEN export DB changes (if any)\n\nCurrent order is: Export → Commit → Pull → Import → Push\n\nThis is a fundamental architecture change to the sync flow.\n\n## Workaround\n\nUse --no-auto-flush and manually control the sync order, or disable daemon auto-export.\n\n## Evidence\n\nFrom user investigation:\n- At 595b7943 (13:20:30): 5 open issues\n- At 10239812 (13:28:39): 0 open issues\n- All 5 issues had their status changed from open to closed\n- Count stayed at 5 (not a deletion issue)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-29T17:33:26.744766-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-29T19:24:31.010075-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-29T19:24:31.010075-08:00"}

{"id":"bd-imj","title":"Deletion propagation via deletions manifest","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen `bd cleanup -f` or `bd delete` removes issues in one clone, those deletions don't propagate to other clones. The import logic only creates/updates, never deletes. This causes \"resurrection\" where deleted issues reappear.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nImport sees DB issues not in JSONL and assumes they're \"local unpushed work\" rather than \"intentionally deleted upstream.\"\n\n## Solution: Deletions Manifest\n\nAdd `.beads/deletions.jsonl` - an append-only log of deleted issue IDs with metadata.\n\n### Format\n```jsonl\n{\"id\":\"bd-xxx\",\"ts\":\"2025-11-25T10:00:00Z\",\"by\":\"stevey\"}\n{\"id\":\"bd-yyy\",\"ts\":\"2025-11-25T10:05:00Z\",\"by\":\"claude\",\"reason\":\"duplicate of bd-zzz\"}\n```\n\n### Fields\n- `id`: Issue ID (required)\n- `ts`: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (required)\n- `by`: Actor who deleted (required)\n- `reason`: Optional context (\"cleanup\", \"duplicate of X\", etc.)\n\n### Import Logic\n```\nFor each DB issue not in JSONL:\n  1. Check deletions manifest → if found, delete from DB\n  2. Fallback: check git history → if found, delete + backfill manifest\n  3. Neither → keep (local unpushed work)\n```\n\n### Conflict Resolution\nSimultaneous deletions from multiple clones are handled naturally:\n- Append-only design means both clones append their deletion records\n- On merge, file contains duplicate entries (same ID, different timestamps)\n- `LoadDeletions` deduplicates by ID (keeps any/first entry)\n- Result: deletion propagates correctly, duplicates are harmless\n\n### Pruning Policy\n- Default retention: 7 days (configurable via `deletions.retention_days`)\n- Auto-compact during `bd sync` is **opt-in** (disabled by default)\n- Hard cap: `deletions.max_entries` (default 50000)\n- Git fallback handles pruned entries (self-healing)\n\n### Self-Healing\nWhen git fallback catches a resurrection (pruned entry), it backfills the manifest. One-time git scan cost, then fast again.\n\n### Size Estimates\n- ~80 bytes/entry\n- 7-day retention with 100 deletions/day = ~56KB\n- Git compressed: ~10KB\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Deletions propagate across clones\n- ✅ O(1) lookup (no git scan in normal case)\n- ✅ Works in shallow clones\n- ✅ Survives history rewrite\n- ✅ Audit trail (who deleted what when)\n- ✅ Self-healing via git fallback\n- ✅ Bounded size via time-based pruning\n\n## References\n- Investigation session: 2025-11-25\n- Related: bd-2q6d (stale database warnings)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:56:01.98027-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-25T16:36:27.965168-08:00","closed_at":"2025-11-25T16:36:27.965168-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-qsm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.821911-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-x2i","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.851712-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-44e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T09:57:42.88154-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bhd","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.675787-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-bgs","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.744648-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-f0n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.80649-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-v29","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:23.864569-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-mdw","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:48.592492-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-imj","depends_on_id":"bd-03r","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-25T14:56:54.295851-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

Where does Gemini CLI store settings? Need to verify `~/.gemini/settings.json` path\n2. Does Gemini CLI use same JSON structure as Claude for hooks?\n3. Can one implementation cover both Gemini CLI and Antigravity?\n4. Should we generate GEMINI.md or rely on AGENTS.md?\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bd setup gemini` installs hooks to Gemini CLI settings\n- [ ] `bd setup gemini --check` verifies installation\n- [ ] `bd doctor` reports Gemini CLI integration status\n- [ ] Documentation updated in docs/SETUP.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-01T23:47:07.399783-08:00","created_by":"beads/crew/wolf","updated_at":"2026-01-02T00:01:16.319278-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-02T00:01:16.319278-08:00"}

JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2.

{"id":"bd-vw8","title":"Switch from deletions manifest to inline tombstones","description":"Replace the current deletions.jsonl manifest with inline tombstone records in issues.jsonl.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe current deletions manifest approach has several issues:\n\n1. **Wild poisoning** - A stale clone's deletions manifest can poison fresh databases when synced\n2. **Two-level merge inconsistency** - Git content merge and beads snapshot merge use different bases\n3. **SyncJSONLToWorktree overwrites** - Blindly copies local JSONL to worktree, losing remote issues\n4. **3-day TTL too aggressive** - Deletions expire before dormant branches get merged\n\n## Proposed Solution: Inline Tombstones\n\nInstead of a separate deletions.jsonl file, embed deletion records directly in issues.jsonl:\n\n```json\n{\"id\":\"beads-abc\",\"status\":\"tombstone\",\"title\":\"Original title\",\"deleted_at\":\"2025-12-01T...\",\"deleted_by\":\"user\",\"expires_at\":\"2025-12-31T...\"}\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Single source of truth** - No separate manifest to sync/merge\n2. **Participates in normal 3-way merge** - Deletion conflicts resolved same as other fields\n3. **Atomic with issue data** - Can't have orphaned deletions or missing tombstones\n4. **Preserves metadata** - Can optionally keep title/type for audit trail\n\n### Design Decisions Needed\n\n1. **TTL duration** - 30 days default? Configurable via config.yaml?\n2. **Tombstone content** - Minimal (just ID + timestamps) vs. full issue preservation?\n3. **Migration path** - How to handle existing deletions.jsonl files?\n4. **Status value** - Use \"tombstone\" or \"deleted\"? (tombstone clearer, deleted more intuitive)\n5. **Merge semantics** - Does tombstone always win, or use updated_at like other fields?\n\n### Migration Strategy\n\n1. On import, convert deletions.jsonl entries to tombstones in JSONL\n2. Deprecate but still read deletions.jsonl for backward compatibility\n3. Stop writing to deletions.jsonl after N versions\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- GitHub #464: Beads deletes issues (fresh clone sync problem)\n- bd-2e0: Add TTL to deletions manifest entries (current 3-day TTL)\n- bd-53c: bd sync corrupts issues.jsonl in multi-clone environments","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-05T13:42:24.384792-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T09:53:43.250574-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-13T09:53:43.250574-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-1r5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:31.111259-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-2m7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:33.57722-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-dli","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:34.902784-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-zvg","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:57:36.665817-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-fbj","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.081452-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-olt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.118268-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-0ih","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.155689-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-3b4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.192575-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-dve","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.227233-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-8f9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.262816-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-s3v","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.299481-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"},{"issue_id":"bd-vw8","depends_on_id":"bd-okh","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-05T15:14:59.337656-08:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

Find open gh:run gates without await_id\n2. Query: gh run list --workflow=\u003cgate.workflow\u003e --limit=5\n3. Match run to gate (by branch, commit, or time proximity)\n4.

Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Run `gt done` to signal completion (branch stays local)\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T22:29:42.167649-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-13h","title":"🤝 HANDOFF: Patrol system design - Beacon, Runner, Deacon molecule","description":"## Context\n\nWorking on gt-7918: Patrols epic. User wants next session to ultrathink on:\n1. Beacon architecture\n2. Patrol runner implementation\n3. Deacons specific patrol molecule\n\n## Design Thinking So Far\n\n### The Beacon\n\nThe beacon is the heartbeat. Three implementation options:\n\n**Option A: Internal Ticker (Recommended)**\n- Deacon runs long-lived with goroutine ticker\n- Pros: Integrated, no external deps, can coordinate multiple patrols\n- Cons: Dies if Deacon crashes\n- Implementation: time.NewTicker(30 * time.Second) in Deacon main loop\n\n**Option B: External Cron**\n- System cron fires gt deacon tick every N seconds\n- Pros: Survives Deacon crashes, Unix-y\n- Cons: Requires system setup, less integrated\n\n**Option C: Mail-Based**\n- Separate beacon process sends TICK mail to Deacon\n- Pros: Reuses mail infrastructure\n- Cons: Overhead, another process to manage\n\nLean toward Option A with Option B as fallback.\n\n### Patrol Runner Algorithm\n\nKey insights:\n- Mail interrupts between steps, not during\n- State persisted after each step (crash recovery)\n- Session reset is just another step type\n- Loop delay prevents tight-looping on all-skipped iterations\n\nPseudocode:\n  while true:\n    for step in patrol.steps:\n      if hasUrgentMail(): handleMail(); continue\n      if now - step.lastRun \u003c step.cooldown: skip; continue\n      execute(step)\n      step.lastRun = now\n      if step.type == session-reset: handoff and return\n      savePatrolState()\n    sleep(loopDelay)\n\n### Deacon Patrol Molecule\n\nmol-deacon-patrol:\n  type: patrol\n  loop_to: health-check\n  loop_delay: 5s\n\n  steps:\n    - health-check (30s, critical) - Check sessions responsive\n    - witness-ping (1m, active) - Verify Witness alive\n    - session-gc (5m, maintenance) - Clean dead sessions\n    - orphan-check (10m, maintenance) - Find lost work\n    - session-reset (30m, periodic) - Cycle for memory\n\n### State Persistence\n\nRecommendation: Hybrid\n- Patrol definition in beads (the molecule)\n- Runtime state in local file (fast)\n- Periodic sync of state to beads (durability)\n\n### Error Handling\n\n1. Log error with step ID\n2. Increment errorCount\n3. Circuit breaker if threshold exceeded\n4. Escalate critical failures to Mayor\n5. Continue to next step\n\n### Open Questions for Next Session\n\n1. How does Deacon bootstrap patrol on fresh start?\n2. Multi-rig coordination - one patrol per rig or global?\n3. Patrol priority vs spawn requests?\n4. Observability - gt patrol status, metrics, alerting\n\n## Files to Look At\n\n- internal/cmd/molecule.go - existing molecule infrastructure\n- internal/cmd/spawn.go - MoleculeContext pattern\n- internal/cmd/prime.go - outputMoleculeContext\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Sketch Deacon patrol molecule in beads format\n2. Implement PatrolStep struct with cooldown logic\n3. Add patrol runner to Deacon\n4. Integrate with auto-handoff (gt-bcwn)\n5. Add gt patrol status command\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-7918: Patrols epic\n- gt-bcwn: Auto-handoff","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:22:16.95082-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.535909-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.535909-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

The prompt just sits there until manually nudged.\n\n## Evidence\n\n```\n$ gt spawn --issue gt-rixa --rig gastown --create\n...\n✓ Session started. Attach with: gt session at gastown/furiosa\n  Polecat nudged to start working\n  Witness notified to monitor startup\n```\n\nSession shows:\n```\n\u003e You have a work assignment. Run 'gt mail inbox' to see it, then start\n  working on issue gt-rixa.\n\n  ⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)\n```\n\nBut Claude doesn't respond. Manual nudge required:\n```\n$ gt nudge gt-gastown-furiosa \"Please start working...\"\n```\n\nAfter nudge, polecat immediately starts working correctly.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nThe spawn inject happens before Claude Code is fully initialized. The text arrives in the input buffer, but Claude hasn't started listening yet. By the time Claude starts, the input has already been 'consumed' as initial prompt text but not submitted.\n\n## Resolution Plan\n\nThis will be solved by the **polecat molecule workflow** (mol-polecat-work), which provides structured lifecycle management. The molecule approach handles startup, work, and shutdown as discrete steps with proper state tracking.\n\n**Blocked on**: beads/crew/dave completing ephemeral molecules (bd mol bond, ephemeral beads repo).\n\n## Workaround\n\nFor now, use `gt nudge` if a polecat doesn't start within ~30 seconds of spawn.\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Run `bd sync --from-main` to get fresh beads\n3. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n4. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n5. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n6. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n7. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T17:25:14.703451-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.248735-08:00","close_reason":"Cleanup: stale mail","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.248735-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-2cchm","title":"bd repair: Fix orphaned deps/labels when database won't open","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen the database has orphaned foreign key references, the migration invariant check fails, preventing the database from opening. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where `bd doctor --fix` can't run because it can't open the database.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd `bd repair` command (or `bd doctor --force-repair`) that:\n1. Opens SQLite directly, bypassing the normal open path with invariant checks\n2. Deletes orphaned dependencies (issue_id or depends_on_id not in issues)\n3. Deletes orphaned labels (issue_id not in issues)\n4. Runs WAL checkpoint to persist changes\n5. Then allows normal bd commands to work\n\n## Implementation\n\n```go\n// In cmd/repair.go or extend doctor.go\nfunc repairDatabase(dbPath string) error {\n    db, err := sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", dbPath)\n    // No migrations, no invariant checks\n    \n    // Delete orphans\n    db.Exec(\"DELETE FROM dependencies WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM issues WHERE id = issue_id)\")\n    db.Exec(\"DELETE FROM dependencies WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM issues WHERE id = depends_on_id) AND depends_on_id NOT LIKE 'external:%'\")\n    db.Exec(\"DELETE FROM labels WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM issues WHERE id = issue_id)\")\n    \n    db.Exec(\"PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)\")\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\nThis is the emergency escape hatch when things go wrong.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-28T23:34:07.915949-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-07T01:30:22.655766-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented bd repair command","deleted_at":"2026-01-07T01:30:22.655766-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"bug"}

Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:07:53.163285-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Created helper file:\n  internal/storage/sqlite/external_deps.go\n\nKey function: CheckExternalDep() opens remote beads DB and checks\nfor closed issue with provides:\u003ccapability\u003e label.\n\n**Design challenge:** The blocked_cache.go uses pure SQL CTE, but\nexternal dep resolution requires Go code to open external DBs.\n\n**Options:**\n1. Two-phase cache rebuild: collect external refs in Go, create temp table, run CTE\n2. Post-filter in GetReadyWork: let cache include all external deps, filter at query time\n3. Hybrid: mark in cache, but also show resolution status in bd blocked output\n\nI started option 1 but reverted the partial change. The external_deps.go\nhelper is ready to use.\n\n## Files Changed\n\n- internal/config/config.go (config funcs)\n- internal/config/config_test.go (tests)\n- cmd/bd/dep.go (external: prefix)\n- cmd/bd/external_ref_test.go (tests)\n- cmd/bd/ship.go (new command)\n- cmd/bd/label.go (namespace protection)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/blocked_cache.go (external deps in cache)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/ready.go (external deps in GetBlockedIssues)\n- internal/storage/sqlite/external_deps.go (resolution helper - WIP)\n- docs/CONFIG.md (documentation)\n\nCommits pushed to main.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T23:14:28.31391-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.501646-08:00","close_reason":"Cleanup: stale mail","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.501646-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

Mayor sends to gastown/Toast, lands in gitignored\nrig-level beads. Toast never sees it.\n\n## Root Cause: Three-Level Confusion\n\nCurrent architecture has three levels:\n- ~/gt/.beads/ (Town, hq-*) - Mayor mail\n- ~/gt/gastown/.beads/ (Rig, gitignored) - BROKEN middle child\n- ~/gt/gastown/crew/max/.beads/ (Clone, gt-*) - project issues\n\n## Solution: Two-Level Only\n\nAll mail goes to town beads. Period.\n\n| Level | Location | Prefix | Purpose |\n|-------|----------|--------|---------|\n| Town | ~/gt/.beads/ | hq-* | ALL mail, coordination |\n| Clone | \u003crig\u003e/crew/*/.beads/ | gt-* | Project issues only |\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. gt mail * always uses town root\n   - Replace findBeadsWorkDirForAddress() with simple town root lookup\n   - All mail commands use workspace.FindFromCwdOrError() directly\n\n2. Remove rig-level .beads/\n   - Delete ~/gt/gastown/.beads/\n   - Remove any code that creates/uses rig-level beads\n\n3. Issue filing stays in clones\n   - bd create in a clone still uses that clone's beads\n\n## Files to Change\n\n- internal/cmd/mail.go: Replace routing logic\n- ~/gt/gastown/.beads/: Delete directory\n- CLAUDE.md files: Update docs","notes":"Rig-level beads (gastown/.beads) has 95 stale gt-* issues.

{"id":"hq-65jk","title":"Epic: Async Gates for Agent Coordination","description":"## Summary\n\nAgents need an async primitive for waiting on external events (CI completion,\nAPI responses, human approval). Currently they either poll wastefully or can't\nresume after handoff.\n\n## Design: Deacon-Managed Gates\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n**Gate** = wisp issue that blocks until external condition is met\n- Type: `gate`\n- Phase: wisp (never synced, ephemeral)\n- Assignee: `deacon/` (Deacon monitors it)\n- Fields: `await_type`, `await_id`, `timeout`, `waiters[]`\n\n**Await Types:**\n- `gh:run:\u003cid\u003e` - GitHub Actions run completion\n- `gh:pr:\u003cid\u003e` - PR merged/closed\n- `timer:\u003cduration\u003e` - Simple delay (e.g., \"5m\", \"1h\")\n- `human:\u003cprompt\u003e` - Human approval required\n- `mail:\u003cpattern\u003e` - Wait for mail matching pattern\n\n### Workflow\n\n```\nAgent                              Deacon\n  |                                   |\n  |-- bd gate create                  |\n  |     --await gh:run:123            |\n  |     --timeout 30m                 |\n  |     --notify beads/dave     -----\u003e| (registers gate)\n  |                                   |\n  |-- handoff \u0026 exit                  |\n  :                                   |\n  :                                   |-- patrol: check gates\n  :                                   |-- gh run 123: in_progress\n  :                                   |-- gh run 123: in_progress\n  :                                   |-- gh run 123: completed\n  :                                   |\n  |\u003c-- mail: \"Gate cleared\" ----------|\n  |                                   |-- bd gate close \u003cid\u003e\n  |-- (new session resumes)           |\n```\n\n### Timeout \u0026 Escalation\n\n1. Gate created with timeout (e.g., 30m)\n2. Deacon tracks elapsed time\n3. If timeout reached:\n   - Deacon notifies waiters: \"Gate timed out\"\n   - Waiter can: retry, escalate to human, or fail gracefully\n4. Witness sees stuck worker, nudges them\n5. Worker escalates to human if needed\n\n### Multiple Waiters\n\nGates support multiple waiters via `waiters[]` array:\n```bash\nbd gate create --await gh:run:123 --notify agent1 --notify agent2\n```\n\nAll waiters get notified when gate clears.\n\n### Commands\n\n```bash\n# Create gate (returns gate ID)\nbd gate create --await \u003ctype\u003e:\u003cid\u003e --timeout \u003cduration\u003e --notify \u003caddr\u003e\n\n# Check gate status\nbd gate show \u003cid\u003e\n\n# List open gates\nbd gate list\n\n# Close gate (usually done by Deacon)\nbd gate close \u003cid\u003e --reason \"completed\"\n\n# Add waiter to existing gate\nbd gate wait \u003cid\u003e --notify \u003caddr\u003e\n```\n\n### Implementation in Deacon Patrol\n\n```go\nfunc (d *Deacon) checkGates(ctx context.Context) {\n    gates, _ := d.store.ListOpenGates(ctx)\n\n    for _, gate := range gates {\n        // Check timeout\n        if time.Since(gate.CreatedAt) \u003e gate.Timeout {\n            d.notifyWaiters(gate, \"timeout\")\n            d.closeGate(gate, \"timed out\")\n            continue\n        }\n\n        // Check condition\n        if d.checkCondition(gate.AwaitType, gate.AwaitID) {\n            d.notifyWaiters(gate, \"cleared\")\n            d.closeGate(gate, \"condition met\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Children (suggested breakdown)\n\n1. Add `gate` issue type to beads\n2. Add gate fields: await_type, await_id, timeout, waiters\n3. Implement `bd gate create/show/list/close/wait` commands\n4. Add gate checking to Deacon patrol loop\n5. Implement await type handlers (gh:run, gh:pr, timer, human, mail)\n6. Add gate timeout tracking and notification\n7. Integration test: agent waits for CI via gate\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Should gates live in wisp storage or main storage with wisp flag?\n- Do we need a gate catalog (like molecule catalog)?\n- Should `waits-for` dep type work with gates?","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-23T11:35:50.430845-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:19:24.288854-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:19:24.288854-08:00","deleted_by":"stevey","delete_reason":"manual delete","original_type":"epic"}

This is the orchestration layer - errors here break everything.\n\n## What Was Implemented\n\n### 1. Mail Routing (internal/mail/router.go, mailbox.go)\n- Router resolves correct beads DB based on recipient address\n- Town-level (mayor/, deacon/) -\u003e ~/gt/.beads\n- Rig-level (rig/polecat) -\u003e ~/gt/\u003crig\u003e/.beads\n- Sets BEADS_DIR env var for all bd commands\n\n### 2. Shared Beads for Polecats (internal/polecat/manager.go)\n- setupSharedBeads() creates .beads/redirect after worktree creation\n- Redirect contains '../../.beads' pointing to rig's shared DB\n- Eliminates JSONL merge conflicts between polecat clones\n\n## Review Tasks\n\n### Architecture Docs Overhaul\n- [ ] Update docs/architecture.md with two-level beads model\n- [ ] Document mail routing flow (sender -\u003e router -\u003e correct beads)\n- [ ] Document shared beads redirect mechanism\n- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md files for mayor, crew, polecats with accurate info\n\n### Code Review\n- [ ] Review router.go: detectTownRoot(), resolveBeadsDir(), isTownLevelAddress()\n- [ ] Review mailbox.go: BEADS_DIR usage in all bd command calls\n- [ ] Review manager.go: setupSharedBeads() error handling\n- [ ] Check edge cases: What if rig .beads doesn't exist? What if redirect is invalid?\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Test: Mayor sends to polecat (should use rig beads)\n- [ ] Test: Polecat sends to mayor (should use town beads)\n- [ ] Test: Polecat sends to sibling polecat (should use rig beads)\n- [ ] Test: Spawn new polecat, verify redirect created\n- [ ] Test: bd commands from polecat use shared rig database\n- [ ] Test: Multiple polecats can read/write same issues without conflicts\n\n### Edge Cases to Verify\n- What happens if town root detection fails?\n- What happens if rig beads dir doesn't exist when sending?\n- What happens if redirect file is malformed?\n- Do crew workers (real .beads, not redirects) still work?\n\n## Files Changed\n- gastown/crew/max/internal/mail/router.go\n- gastown/crew/max/internal/mail/mailbox.go\n- gastown/crew/max/internal/polecat/manager.go\n(synced to polecats/nux, polecats/furiosa)\n\n## Key Commit\ngastown main: b9f93fc 'feat: implement rig/town-level mail routing and shared beads for polecats'\n\n-- Mayor","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:06:40.053339-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.557284-08:00","close_reason":"Review complete.

This is a significant feature that needs review before we consider it production-ready.\n\n### What was implemented:\n1. Gate issue type (types.TypeGate)\n2. Gate-specific fields: AwaitType, AwaitID, Timeout, Waiters\n3. SQLite migration 027_gate_columns\n4. CLI commands: bd gate create/show/list/close/wait\n\n### Review focus areas:\n- internal/types/types.go - Gate field definitions and ComputeContentHash\n- internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/027_gate_columns.go - New migration\n- cmd/bd/gate.go - New CLI commands (525 lines)\n- All modified storage files (queries.go, transaction.go, etc.)\n\n### Questions to consider:\n- Is the Wisp flag correct for gates? (ephemeral by default)\n- Should gate commands work via daemon RPC? (currently --no-daemon required)\n- Is the await spec parsing robust enough?\n- Are the JSON serialization patterns correct for Duration and []string fields?\n\n### Commands to review:\ngit show 47b86b35 --stat\ngit show 47b86b35 -- cmd/bd/gate.go\n\n### Remaining epic tasks (in gt, not beads):\nbd-is6m, bd-2l03, bd-ykqu, bd-rl5t - Deacon patrol integration","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T12:08:27.523681-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.442469-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.442469-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

Switch to main: `git checkout main \u0026\u0026 git pull`\n2. Merge feature branch: `git merge feature/rename-harness-to-hq`\n3. Resolve conflicts by keeping:\n   - Main's routing code (detectTownRoot, resolveBeadsDir, multi-level routing)\n   - Feature branch's bd command approach (bd list/create instead of bd mail)\n   - Feature branch's ParseLabels() method\n   - Both pinned sorting implementations (should be similar)\n4. Update router.go to use `bd create --type message` instead of `bd mail send`\n5.

The current IsRunning checks only verify tmux session exists, not that Claude is actually processing.\n\n## Problem\n- Refinery session might be hung (Claude crashed, infinite loop, etc.)\n- tmux HasSession returns true, so auto-start doesn't trigger\n- MRs pile up with no processing\n\n## Solution Options\n1. **Activity-based detection**: Check last output timestamp in tmux\n2. **Heartbeat file**: Agents write timestamp to file, check staleness\n3. **Prompt detection**: Look for Claude '\u003e' prompt indicating idle/stuck\n\n## Related\n- gt-bjft (spawn auto-start) assumes IsRunning means healthy\n- Witness patrol assumes running refinery is processing\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:38:43.985762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Polecat completes work\n2. Polecat runs 'gt mq submit'\n3. MR is added to integration queue\n4. Polecat automatically cleans up\n\n## Implementation Options\nA. mq submit triggers cleanup - cleanest, single command does both\nB. Refinery triggers cleanup via Witness message\nC. Molecule-driven - define cleanup as final phase\n\n## Recommendation\nOption A is simplest - add cleanup to mq submit:\n1. Submit MR to queue\n2. Automatically run cleanup (same as gt handoff --shutdown)\n3.

Create logger setup (internal/daemon/logger.go)\n\n```go\npackage daemon\n\nimport (\n    \"io\"\n    \"log/slog\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\n// SetupLogger configures the daemon logger.\n// Returns a cleanup function to close the log file.\nfunc SetupLogger(logPath string, jsonFormat bool, level slog.Level) (func(), error) {\n    var w io.Writer = os.Stderr\n    var cleanup func()\n    \n    if logPath \\!= \"\" {\n        f, err := os.OpenFile(logPath, os.O_CREATE|os.O_APPEND|os.O_WRONLY, 0600)\n        if err \\!= nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        w = io.MultiWriter(os.Stderr, f)\n        cleanup = func() { f.Close() }\n    }\n    \n    var handler slog.Handler\n    opts := \u0026slog.HandlerOptions{Level: level}\n    \n    if jsonFormat {\n        handler = slog.NewJSONHandler(w, opts)\n    } else {\n        handler = slog.NewTextHandler(w, opts)\n    }\n    \n    slog.SetDefault(slog.New(handler))\n    \n    return cleanup, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add log level flag\n\nIn cmd/bd/daemon.go:\n```go\ndaemonCmd.Flags().String(\"log-level\", \"info\", \"Log level (debug, info, warn, error)\")\ndaemonCmd.Flags().Bool(\"log-json\", false, \"Output logs in JSON format\")\n```\n\n### 3. Replace fmt.Fprintf with slog calls\n\n**Pattern 1: Simple messages**\n```go\n// Before\nfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Starting daemon on %s\\n\", socketPath)\n\n// After\nslog.Info(\"starting daemon\", \"socket\", socketPath)\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: Errors**\n```go\n// Before\nfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error: failed to connect: %v\\n\", err)\n\n// After\nslog.Error(\"failed to connect\", \"error\", err)\n```\n\n**Pattern 3: Debug info**\n```go\n// Before\nif debug {\n    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Received request: %s\\n\", method)\n}\n\n// After\nslog.Debug(\"received request\", \"method\", method)\n```\n\n**Pattern 4: Structured data**\n```go\n// Before\nfmt.Fprintf(logFile, \"Import: %d created, %d updated\\n\", created, updated)\n\n// After\nslog.Info(\"import completed\", \n    \"created\", created,\n    \"updated\", updated,\n    \"unchanged\", unchanged,\n    \"duration_ms\", duration.Milliseconds())\n```\n\n### 4. Files to Update\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| cmd/bd/daemon.go | Add log flags, call SetupLogger |\n| internal/daemon/server.go | Replace fmt with slog |\n| internal/daemon/rpc_handler.go | Replace fmt with slog |\n| internal/daemon/sync.go | Replace fmt with slog |\n| internal/daemon/autoflush.go | Replace fmt with slog |\n| internal/daemon/logger.go | New file |\n\n### 5. Log output examples\n\n**Text format (default):**\n```\ntime=2025-12-23T12:30:00Z level=INFO msg=\"daemon started\" socket=/tmp/bd.sock pid=12345\ntime=2025-12-23T12:30:01Z level=INFO msg=\"import completed\" created=5 updated=3 duration_ms=150\ntime=2025-12-23T12:30:05Z level=WARN msg=\"sync branch diverged\" local_ahead=2 remote_ahead=1\n```\n\n**JSON format (--log-json):**\n```json\n{\"time\":\"2025-12-23T12:30:00Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"daemon started\",\"socket\":\"/tmp/bd.sock\",\"pid\":12345}\n{\"time\":\"2025-12-23T12:30:01Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"import completed\",\"created\":5,\"updated\":3,\"duration_ms\":150}\n```\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n1. **Add logger.go** with SetupLogger\n2. **Update daemon startup** to initialize slog\n3. **Convert one file at a time** (start with server.go)\n4. **Test after each file**\n5. **Remove old logging code** once all converted\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# Start daemon with debug logging\nbd daemon start --log-level debug\n\n# Check logs\nbd daemons logs . | head -20\n\n# Test JSON output\nbd daemon start --log-json --log-level debug\nbd daemons logs . | jq .\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All daemon logging uses slog\n- --log-level controls verbosity\n- --log-json produces machine-parseable output\n- Log entries have consistent structure\n- No fmt.Fprintf to stderr in daemon code\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5.

Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:07:30.611484-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-ckqt","title":"📋 Work Assignment: Deacon patrol wisps should use town beads, not gastown rig beads","description":"Issue: gt-ci84\nTitle: Deacon patrol wisps should use town beads, not gastown rig beads\nPriority: P1\nType: bug\n\nDescription:\n## Problem\n\nThe deacon is a town-level role but stores patrol wisps in gastown/mayor/rig/.beads/ (see internal/cmd/prime.go:691). This fails for users who don't have the gastown rig installed.\n\n## Correct Architecture\n\nDeacon -\u003e ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ (town-level, no rig dependency)\n\nTown-level ephemeral work (deacon patrols) should use town wisp storage, just like rig-level ephemeral work (witness/refinery patrols) uses rig wisp storage.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Town Setup (gt install / gt town init)\n\n- Create ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ directory during town initialization\n- Initialize as git repo (for local commits, not synced)\n- Add config.yaml with wisp: true\n- Ensure .beads-wisp/ is gitignored at town level\n\nFiles:\n- internal/cmd/install.go (or equivalent town init)\n- internal/town/manager.go (if exists)\n\n### 2. Rig Setup (gt rig init)\n\nAlready creates \u003crig\u003e/.beads-wisp/ - verify this is working:\n- internal/rig/manager.go:375 (beadsDir := filepath.Join(rigPath, \".beads-wisp\"))\n- internal/rig/manager.go:394 (ensureGitignoreEntry)\n\n### 3. Deacon Code Fixes\n\nUpdate deacon to use town wisp storage:\n- internal/cmd/prime.go:691 - change rigBeadsDir to townWispDir\n- internal/cmd/sling.go - route deacon wisps to town level\n- internal/daemon/daemon.go - any deacon-specific wisp handling\n\n### 4. gt doctor Checks\n\nAdd/update doctor checks for wisp directories:\n- internal/doctor/wisp_check.go - already checks rig wisps\n- Add TownWispCheck to verify ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ exists\n- Add TownWispGitCheck to verify it is a valid git repo\n- Update existing checks to handle both town and rig levels\n\nFiles:\n- internal/doctor/wisp_check.go (extend for town level)\n- internal/doctor/checks.go (register new checks)\n\n### 5. Documentation\n\n- docs/beads-data-plane.md - already updated with three-tier architecture\n- Verify wisp-architecture.md reflects town-level wisps\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Fresh gt install should create ~/gt/.beads-wisp/\n2. gt doctor should pass with no rig installed\n3. Deacon patrol should work without gastown rig\n4. gt sling patrol deacon/ --wisp should route to town wisps\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6.

Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:03:33.08887-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Filed bd-ldb0 for Dave - rename ephemeral → wisp in beads codebase\n2. Updated gt-3x0z epic with wisp terminology (12 children covering full integration)\n3. Updated docs/architecture.md with:\n   - Steam engine metaphor section\n   - Wisp Molecules section (full workflow docs)\n   - Updated polecat workflow to be molecule-first\n4. Updated docs/vision.md with matching terminology\n\n## What's Next\n\nDave is preparing the wisp release in beads. While that happens, we need to:\n\n1. **Finalize wisp incorporation into patrols** - gt-rana patrol system needs wisp integration\n   - Patrols = infinite wisp loops (execute → squash → sleep → repeat)\n   - Each patrol iteration creates wisp molecule, squashes to digest\n   - Full audit trail without ledger bloat\n\n2. **Design the spawn → wisp workflow** - How gt spawn creates wisp molecules\n   - Spawn receives issue + proto template\n   - Bond creates wisp molecule from proto\n   - Polecat executes wisp steps\n   - Squash to digest before shutdown\n\n3. **Review gt-3x0z children** for completeness:\n   - Phase 1: Setup (wisp storage, schema)\n   - Phase 2: Spawn Integration\n   - Phase 3: Completion Flow (squash/burn)\n   - Phase 4: Patrol Integration\n   - Phase 5: Polish\n\n## Key Beads\n\n- gt-3x0z: Epic: Wisp Molecule Integration (12 children)\n- gt-rana: Patrol System Implementation\n- bd-ldb0: Rename ephemeral → wisp (for Dave)\n\n## Files Changed\n\n- docs/architecture.md - comprehensive wisp documentation\n- docs/vision.md - steam engine metaphor and terminology\n\nThe foundation is laid.

{"id":"hq-eb12","title":"📋 Work Assignment: Add daemon RPC support for gate commands","description":"Issue: bd-likt\nTitle: Add daemon RPC support for gate commands\nPriority: P3\nType: task\n\nDescription:\nAdd daemon RPC support for gate commands.\n\n## Current State\nGate commands require --no-daemon flag because they use direct SQLite access:\n- Gate create needs to write await_type, await_id, timeout_ns, waiters fields\n- Gate wait needs to update waiters JSON array\n- Daemon RPC doesnt have methods for these operations\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add RPC methods to internal/rpc/protocol.go\n\n```go\n// Gate operations\ntype GateCreateArgs struct {\n    Title     string        \\`json:\"title\"\\`\n    AwaitType string        \\`json:\"await_type\"\\`\n    AwaitID   string        \\`json:\"await_id\"\\`\n    Timeout   time.Duration \\`json:\"timeout\"\\`\n    Waiters   []string      \\`json:\"waiters\"\\`\n}\n\ntype GateCreateResult struct {\n    Issue *types.Issue \\`json:\"issue\"\\`\n}\n\ntype GateListArgs struct {\n    All bool \\`json:\"all\"\\` // Include closed gates\n}\n\ntype GateListResult struct {\n    Gates []*types.Issue \\`json:\"gates\"\\`\n}\n\ntype GateWaitArgs struct {\n    GateID  string   \\`json:\"gate_id\"\\`\n    Waiters []string \\`json:\"waiters\"\\` // Additional waiters to add\n}\n\ntype GateWaitResult struct {\n    Gate        *types.Issue \\`json:\"gate\"\\`\n    AddedCount  int          \\`json:\"added_count\"\\`\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Add handler methods to internal/daemon/rpc_handler.go\n\n```go\nfunc (h *RPCHandler) GateCreate(ctx context.Context, args *rpc.GateCreateArgs) (*rpc.GateCreateResult, error) {\n    now := time.Now()\n    gate := \u0026types.Issue{\n        Title:     args.Title,\n        IssueType: types.TypeGate,\n        Status:    types.StatusOpen,\n        Priority:  1,\n        Assignee:  \"deacon/\",\n        Wisp:      true,\n        AwaitType: args.AwaitType,\n        AwaitID:   args.AwaitID,\n        Timeout:   args.Timeout,\n        Waiters:   args.Waiters,\n        CreatedAt: now,\n        UpdatedAt: now,\n    }\n    gate.ContentHash = gate.ComputeContentHash()\n    \n    if err := h.store.CreateIssue(ctx, gate, h.actor); err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    \n    return \u0026rpc.GateCreateResult{Issue: gate}, nil\n}\n\nfunc (h *RPCHandler) GateList(ctx context.Context, args *rpc.GateListArgs) (*rpc.GateListResult, error) {\n    gateType := types.TypeGate\n    filter := types.IssueFilter{IssueType: \u0026gateType}\n    if !args.All {\n        openStatus := types.StatusOpen\n        filter.Status = \u0026openStatus\n    }\n    \n    gates, err := h.store.SearchIssues(ctx, \"\", filter)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    \n    return \u0026rpc.GateListResult{Gates: gates}, nil\n}\n\nfunc (h *RPCHandler) GateWait(ctx context.Context, args *rpc.GateWaitArgs) (*rpc.GateWaitResult, error) {\n    gate, err := h.store.GetIssue(ctx, args.GateID)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    if gate.IssueType != types.TypeGate {\n        return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"%s is not a gate\", args.GateID)\n    }\n    \n    // Merge waiters (dedupe)\n    waiterSet := make(map[string]bool)\n    for _, w := range gate.Waiters {\n        waiterSet[w] = true\n    }\n    added := 0\n    for _, w := range args.Waiters {\n        if !waiterSet[w] {\n            gate.Waiters = append(gate.Waiters, w)\n            waiterSet[w] = true\n            added++\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if added \u003e 0 {\n        // Update via store\n        updates := map[string]interface{}{\n            \"waiters\": gate.Waiters,\n        }\n        if err := h.store.UpdateIssue(ctx, args.GateID, updates, h.actor); err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return \u0026rpc.GateWaitResult{Gate: gate, AddedCount: added}, nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Register methods in daemon\n\nIn internal/daemon/server.go, register the new methods:\n```go\nrpc.RegisterMethod(\"gate.create\", h.GateCreate)\nrpc.RegisterMethod(\"gate.list\", h.GateList)\nrpc.RegisterMethod(\"gate.wait\", h.GateWait)\n```\n\n### 4. Add client methods to internal/rpc/client.go\n\n```go\nfunc (c *Client) GateCreate(ctx context.Context, args *GateCreateArgs) (*GateCreateResult, error) {\n    var result GateCreateResult\n    err := c.Call(ctx, \"gate.create\", args, \u0026result)\n    return \u0026result, err\n}\n\nfunc (c *Client) GateList(ctx context.Context, args *GateListArgs) (*GateListResult, error) {\n    var result GateListResult\n    err := c.Call(ctx, \"gate.list\", args, \u0026result)\n    return \u0026result, err\n}\n\nfunc (c *Client) GateWait(ctx context.Context, args *GateWaitArgs) (*GateWaitResult, error) {\n    var result GateWaitResult\n    err := c.Call(ctx, \"gate.wait\", args, \u0026result)\n    return \u0026result, err\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Update cmd/bd/gate.go to use daemon\n\n```go\n// In gateCreateCmd Run:\nif daemonClient != nil {\n    result, err := daemonClient.GateCreate(ctx, \u0026rpc.GateCreateArgs{\n        Title:     title,\n        AwaitType: awaitType,\n        AwaitID:   awaitID,\n        Timeout:   timeout,\n        Waiters:   notifyAddrs,\n    })\n    if err != nil {\n        FatalError(\"gate create: %v\", err)\n    }\n    gate = result.Issue\n} else {\n    // Existing direct store code\n}\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. **internal/rpc/protocol.go** - Add Gate*Args/Result types\n2. **internal/daemon/rpc_handler.go** - Add handler methods\n3. **internal/daemon/server.go** - Register methods\n4. **internal/rpc/client.go** - Add client methods\n5. **cmd/bd/gate.go** - Use daemon client when available\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# Start daemon\nbd daemon start\n\n# Test via daemon (should work without --no-daemon)\nbd gate create --await timer:5m --notify beads/dave\nbd gate list\nbd gate wait \u003cid\u003e --notify beads/alice\n\n# Verify daemon handled it\nbd daemons logs . | grep gate\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All gate commands work without --no-daemon\n- Same behavior in daemon vs direct mode\n- Waiters array updates correctly via RPC\n- Tests pass for RPC gate operations\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:05:56.450465-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Designed fix with Steve.\n\n## Key Decision: Two-Level Model Only\n- **Town** (`~/gt/.beads/`, prefix `hq-*`): All mail/coordination\n- **Project** (`\u003crig\u003e/crew/*/.beads/`): Project issues\n\nKill the rig-level (`~/gt/gastown/.beads/` gitignored) - unnecessary complexity.\n\n## Critical Bug: gt-4qey\nMail routing is broken. `gt mail send` uses sender's CWD beads, not recipient's.\n- Mayor sends to gastown/Toast → lands in HQ beads\n- Toast checks their project beads → never sees it\n\n**Fix**: `gt mail *` should ALWAYS use town root (`~/gt/.beads/`).\n\n## New Feature Needed: gt file \u003crig\u003e\nFor cross-rig issue filing:\n```bash\ngt file beads \"Bug in parser\" --type=bug --priority=1\n```\ngt knows all rigs → routes to correct project beads.\n\n## Filed Issues\n- **gt-4qey**: Cross-level mail routing broken (P1)\n- **gt-bnik**: gt nudge should accept fuzzy session names (P3)\n\n## Max's Work\nMax committed mail refactoring (uses bd create/list instead of bd mail).\nPinned sorting done. But routing needs the fix above.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Fix findMailWorkDir() to always use town root\n2. Delete rig-level .beads/ directories\n3. Add gt file \u003crig\u003e command\n4.

{"id":"hq-gstb","title":"🤝 HANDOFF: Rig/Cook/Run discovery complete - review before swarm","description":"## Session Summary (2025-12-23 Evening)\n\nMajor discovery session. Review ~/gt/docs/insights.md and docs/rig-cook-run.md before swarming gt-8tmz.\n\n### The Big Discovery: Rig/Cook/Run\n\nThree phases of work:\n```\nRIG ────→ COOK ────→ RUN\n(source)  (artifact)  (execution)\n```\n\nTwo composition operators at different abstraction levels:\n- **Rig** = source-level (formula YAML with extends/compose)\n- **Bond** = artifact-level (protos, mols, wisps)\n\nThis preserves the symmetric bond table. No holes. It was a discovery, not an invention.\n\n### Key Artifacts Created\n\n**New docs:**\n- docs/rig-cook-run.md - Canonical spec for the three phases\n\n**Updated docs:**\n- docs/molecule-algebra.md - Three Phases section, rig/bond distinction\n- docs/molecular-chemistry.md - Rig/bond clarification\n- docs/vision.md - Core Innovation 3 now covers Rig/Cook/Run\n\n**New formulas:**\n- .beads/formulas/towers-of-hanoi.formula.yaml - Proves the paradigm\n\n**Formulas converted JSON→YAML:**\n- shiny.formula.yaml\n- rule-of-five.formula.yaml\n- security-audit.formula.yaml\n- shiny-enterprise.formula.yaml\n\n### Epic Status (gt-8tmz)\n\nNow has 27 children. Key new beads:\n- gt-8tmz.24: Document Rig/Cook/Run lifecycle\n- gt-8tmz.25: Implement bd bond command\n- gt-8tmz.26: Direct formula-to-wisp (skip proto)\n- gt-8tmz.27: Computed range expansion (for-each)\n\nPlus safety constraints: cycle detection (.15), aspect self-matching (.16), max expansion depth (.17)\n\n### The Towers of Hanoi Insight\n\nMAKER used voting to solve million-step workflows. We solve it differently:\n- Structure is mechanical (formula generates 2^n-1 moves)\n- Only leaf execution needs AI (trivial: \"move disk X from Y to Z\")\n- No voting needed - nothing to vote on\n\nThis proves the paradigm: structure is computation, content is cognition.\n\n### Before Swarming\n\n1. Read ~/gt/docs/insights.md for session reflections\n2. Read docs/rig-cook-run.md for the lifecycle spec\n3. Review gt-8tmz children for implementation order\n4. Dependencies are set up - .12 (parser) and .13 (cook) are foundational\n\nReady to swarm. The village watches itself.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T19:54:06.614001-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.397349-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.397349-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-hpud","title":"📋 Work Assignment: gt sling pinToHook doesn't set pinned boolean field","description":"Issue: gt-o3is\nTitle: gt sling pinToHook doesn't set pinned boolean field\nPriority: P1\nType: bug\n\nDescription:\n## Updated Root Cause Analysis (2025-12-23)\n\nThe issue is **NOT** in gt as originally thought. It's in the beads (bd) codebase.\n\n### What happens:\n1. `bd pin` correctly sets pinned=1 in SQLite\n2. Any subsequent `bd` command (even `bd show`) resets pinned to 0\n3. This happens even with `--no-auto-import` and `--sandbox` flags\n\n### Evidence:\n```bash\n$ bd --no-daemon pin gt-k08o --for=max\n📌 Pinned gt-k08o to max's hook\n\n$ sqlite3 beads.db 'SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\"gt-k08o\"'\ngt-k08o|1   # ← Correct immediately after pin\n\n$ bd --no-daemon --no-auto-import show gt-k08o\n[shows issue without pinned field]\n\n$ sqlite3 beads.db 'SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\"gt-k08o\"'  \ngt-k08o|0   # ← WRONG\\! bd show overwrote it\n```\n\n### Where to look:\nThe bug is likely in one of these beads code paths:\n- Some import/hydration running despite --no-auto-import\n- WAL mode not flushing before subsequent reads\n- Multi-repo or redirect handling corrupting pinned field\n\n### Workaround:\nThe handoff bead attachment mechanism (AttachMolecule) works correctly.\nThe pinned field is cosmetic for `bd hook` visibility only.\ngt sling correctly uses AttachMolecule for work assignment.\n\n### Next steps:\nCreate a beads issue to fix this properly in the bd codebase.\nThis is not a gt issue.\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T19:27:04.293916-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Deferred: notify, webhook types.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Config Schema\n\nAdd to internal/configfile/config.go:\n\n```go\ntype HooksConfig struct {\n    OnClose []HookEntry `yaml:\"on_close,omitempty\"`\n}\n\ntype HookEntry struct {\n    Command string `yaml:\"command\"`           // Shell command to run\n    Name    string `yaml:\"name,omitempty\"`    // Optional display name\n}\n```\n\nAdd `Hooks HooksConfig` field to Config struct.\n\n### 2. Hook Execution\n\nCreate internal/hooks/close_hooks.go:\n\n```go\nfunc RunCloseHooks(ctx context.Context, cfg *configfile.Config, issue *types.Issue) error {\n    for _, hook := range cfg.Hooks.OnClose {\n        cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, \"sh\", \"-c\", hook.Command)\n        cmd.Env = append(os.Environ(),\n            \"BEAD_ID=\"+issue.ID,\n            \"BEAD_TITLE=\"+issue.Title,\n            \"BEAD_TYPE=\"+string(issue.IssueType),\n            \"BEAD_PRIORITY=\"+strconv.Itoa(issue.Priority),\n            \"BEAD_CLOSE_REASON=\"+issue.CloseReason,\n        )\n        cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout\n        cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr\n        if err := cmd.Run(); err \\!= nil {\n            // Log warning but dont fail the close\n            fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Warning: close hook %q failed: %v\\n\", hook.Name, err)\n        }\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Integration Point\n\nIn cmd/bd/close.go, after successful close:\n\n```go\n// Run close hooks\nif cfg := configfile.Load(); cfg \\!= nil {\n    hooks.RunCloseHooks(ctx, cfg, closedIssue)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Example Config\n\n```yaml\n# .beads/config.yaml\nhooks:\n  on_close:\n    - name: show-next\n      command: bd ready --limit 1\n    - name: context-check  \n      command: echo \"Issue $BEAD_ID closed. Check context if nearing limit.\"\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| BEAD_ID | Issue ID (e.g., bd-abc1) |\n| BEAD_TITLE | Issue title |\n| BEAD_TYPE | Issue type (task, bug, feature, etc.) |\n| BEAD_PRIORITY | Priority (0-4) |\n| BEAD_CLOSE_REASON | Close reason if provided |\n\n## Testing\n\nAdd test in internal/hooks/close_hooks_test.go:\n- Test hook execution with mock config\n- Test env vars are set correctly\n- Test hook failure doesnt block close\n\n## Files to Create/Modify\n\n1. **Create:** internal/hooks/close_hooks.go\n2. **Create:** internal/hooks/close_hooks_test.go  \n3. **Modify:** internal/configfile/config.go (add HooksConfig)\n4. **Modify:** cmd/bd/close.go (call RunCloseHooks)\n5. **Modify:** docs/CONFIG.md (document hooks config)\n\n## Out of Scope (Future)\n\n- notify hook type (gt mail integration)\n- webhook type (HTTP POST)\n- on_create, on_update hooks\n- Hook timeout configuration\n- Parallel hook execution\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:05:33.066141-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

JSONL Compaction (`bd compact`)\nPeriodically rewrite JSONL without tombstones:\n```bash\nbd compact  # Removes tombstones, rewrites issues.jsonl\n```\nTrade-off: Loses delete history, but that's in git anyway.\n\n### 2. Tombstone TTL\nAuto-remove tombstones older than N days during sync:\n```go\nif issue.Deleted \u0026\u0026 time.Since(issue.UpdatedAt) \u003e 7*24*time.Hour {\n    // Skip writing to new JSONL\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Archive File\nMove old closed issues to `issues-archive.jsonl`:\n- Not synced regularly\n- Available for historical queries\n- Main JSONL stays small\n\n### 4. Lazy Tombstone Handling  \nDon't write tombstones to JSONL at all - just remove the line:\n- Simpler, but loses cross-clone delete propagation\n- Would need different delete propagation mechanism\n\n## Recommendation\nStart with `bd compact` command - simple, explicit, user-controlled.\n\n## Related\n- gt-tnss: Analysis - Beads database size and hygiene strategy\n- gt-ox67: Maintenance - Regular cleanup of closed MR/gate beads\n\n## Workflow\n1.

{"id":"hq-jyeg","title":"📋 Work Assignment: Standardize error handling: replace direct fmt.Fprintf+os.Exit with FatalError","description":"Issue: bd-qioh\nTitle: Standardize error handling: replace direct fmt.Fprintf+os.Exit with FatalError\nPriority: P2\nType: task\n\nDescription:\nStandardize error handling in cmd/bd/ using FatalError pattern.\n\n## Current State\n~200+ instances of direct `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...) + os.Exit(1)` pattern scattered across cmd/bd/*.go files.\n\n## Target Pattern\n\nUse existing FatalError helper (or create if missing):\n\n```go\n// In cmd/bd/helpers.go or similar\nfunc FatalError(format string, args ...interface{}) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error: \"+format+\"\\n\", args...)\n    os.Exit(1)\n}\n\nfunc FatalErrorf(err error, context string) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error: %s: %v\\n\", context, err)\n    os.Exit(1)\n}\n```\n\n## Transformation\n\n```go\n// Before\nfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error: %v\\n\", err)\nos.Exit(1)\n\n// After\nFatalError(\"%v\", err)\n\n// Before\nfmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"Error: invalid --since duration: %v\\n\", err)\nos.Exit(1)\n\n// After\nFatalError(\"invalid --since duration: %v\", err)\n```\n\n## Files to Update (by occurrence count)\nRun: `grep -c \"os.Exit(1)\" cmd/bd/*.go | sort -t: -k2 -rn | head -20`\n\nPriority files (highest occurrence):\n- close.go\n- show.go\n- sync.go\n- init.go\n- list.go\n- create.go\n- update.go\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Check if FatalError exists** in cmd/bd/helpers.go or create it\n2. **Create migration script** or use sed:\n   ```bash\n   # Find patterns to replace\n   grep -rn \"fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr.*Error.*\\n.*os.Exit(1)\" cmd/bd/\n   ```\n3. **Replace systematically** file by file\n4. **Run tests** after each file to verify behavior unchanged\n5. **Run linter** to catch any missed patterns\n\n## Verification\n```bash\n# Count remaining direct exits (should be near zero)\ngrep -c \"os.Exit(1)\" cmd/bd/*.go | awk -F: \"{sum+=\\$2} END {print sum}\"\n\n# Run tests\ngo test -short ./cmd/bd/...\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All error exits use FatalError/FatalErrorf\n- Consistent \"Error: \" prefix on all error messages\n- Tests pass\n- No behavior changes (exit codes remain 1)\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:06:19.770237-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

Gates work (waits_for creates gate:X labels).\n\n### Next Session Focus\n\n**Town-down review of the patrol system.** These formulas are the schematics for Gas Town's self-propelling wheels. Test them:\n\n1. Pour a patrol mol and walk through the steps manually\n2. Verify the Christmas Ornament pattern works (dynamic arms)\n3. Check that step dependencies create correct execution order\n4. Consider: what's missing before these can run autonomously?\n\n### Key Files\n- Formulas: gastown/crew/joe/.beads/formulas/mol-*.formula.yaml\n- bd cook: beads/mayor/rig/cmd/bd/cook.go\n\n### Config Note\nRun in gastown to allow mol-* imports:\n  bd config set allowed_prefixes 'gt-,mol-'\n\nThis is potentially game-changing.

This becomes the permanent record.\n```\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Run `bd sync --from-main` to get fresh beads\n3. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n4. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n5. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n6. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n7. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T16:28:27.155042-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.252153-08:00","close_reason":"Cleanup: stale mail","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.252153-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

During this time, no patrol cycles ran, no health checks happened.\n\n## Root Cause\nThe Deacon patrol formula (mol-deacon-patrol.formula.toml) tells Claude to manually track health state in context memory, but:\n1. Context memory is ephemeral - lost on cycle/restart\n2. The Go code has proper persistent tooling that's NOT being used:\n   - `gt deacon health-check \u003cagent\u003e` - tracks consecutive failures, returns exit code 2 when force-kill needed\n   - `gt deacon health-state` - shows persistent state (currently empty - never used)\n\n## Who Watches the Watchman?\nBoot has one-time stall detection (`gt peek deacon/` looking for '\u003e Try' prompt) but nothing CONTINUOUSLY watches the Deacon during runtime.\n\n## Fix Required\n1. Update mol-deacon-patrol health-scan step to use `gt deacon health-check` instead of raw `gt nudge`\n2. Add a continuous watchdog for the Deacon itself (Boot daemon? Witness ping check?)\n3.

Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:03:55.725442-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-rfx8","title":"🤝 HANDOFF: Polecat wisp architecture breakthrough","description":"## Context\n\nThis session completed three items:\n1. gt-drbd: Added no-PR instructions to mol-polecat-work (commit 1111ba7)\n2. gt-lek6: Added gt rig reset --stale command (commit 56bcdad)  \n3. Polecat protocol documentation with reified exit-decision step (commit 1a1e49a)\n\n## The Breakthrough: Polecat Wisp Architecture\n\nDuring documentation work, we discovered a gap: polecat.md template exists but isn't injected into polecat context. This led to a fundamental insight:\n\n### Current Model (what I documented)\n- Polecat gets mol-polecat-work as its workflow\n- The molecule IS both the protocol AND the work\n- Conflates 'how to work' with 'what to work on'\n\n### Proposed Model (user's insight)\nPolecats should run a ONE-SHOT WISP (not a looping patrol):\n\n**Step 1: Onboard**\n- Read full polecat protocol (polecat.md template)\n- Learn Gas Town operation, exit strategies, molecule protocol\n- This is the 'how to be a polecat' education\n\n**Step 2: Execute Mol**  \n- Run the assigned molecule (the actual work item)\n- Could span multiple sessions via session continuity\n- The mol is pure work content (epic, issue, feature)\n\n**Step 3: Cleanup**\n- Run final step of the wisp\n- Self-delete / request shutdown\n\n### The Key Insight\n\nThree layers:\n- **Proto**: polecat.md template (instructions for being a polecat)\n- **Wisp**: One-shot harness instantiated from proto (wraps the mol)\n- **Mol**: The work item (issue/epic being processed)\n\nThis mirrors 'engineer in a box' pattern:\n- Proto → Wisp → Mol\n- Wisp provides quality controls, protocols, exit handling\n- Mol is the cocooned work item\n- Plugin/extension points (like refinery/deacon) allow customization\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Separation of concerns**: Protocol (how) vs Work (what)\n2. **Reusability**: Same wisp harness wraps any mol\n3. **Extensibility**: Plugin points for custom behavior\n4. **Session continuity**: Wisp handles multi-session, not the mol\n5. **Blurred control/data planes**: Intentional in Gas Town - agents self-modify\n\n### Analogy\n- Refinery wisp: Loops, processing MRs (mols)\n- Deacon wisp: Loops, doing health checks\n- Polecat wisp: ONE-SHOT, processing one mol, then exits\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Design the polecat wisp structure (3 steps: onboard, execute, cleanup)\n2. Define how proto (polecat.md) becomes wisp\n3. Design plugin/extension points (modeled on refinery/deacon plugins)\n4. Consider: should all 'engineer in a box' mols go proto → wisp → mol?\n\n### Files Changed This Session\n- internal/beads/builtin_molecules.go (mol-polecat-work with exit-decision)\n- prompts/roles/polecat.md (full molecule protocol docs)\n- internal/cmd/rig.go (gt rig reset --stale)\n\n### Related Issues\n- gt-drbd: closed\n- gt-lek6: closed\n- Need to file: Polecat wisp architecture design\n\nThis is fundamental. The user said 'we're onto something pretty fundamental' - agree.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T15:49:06.230776-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.484995-08:00","close_reason":"Cleanup: stale mail","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.484995-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

JSONL Compaction (`bd compact`)\nPeriodically rewrite JSONL without tombstones:\n```bash\nbd compact  # Removes tombstones, rewrites issues.jsonl\n```\nTrade-off: Loses delete history, but that's in git anyway.\n\n### 2. Tombstone TTL\nAuto-remove tombstones older than N days during sync:\n```go\nif issue.Deleted \u0026\u0026 time.Since(issue.UpdatedAt) \u003e 7*24*time.Hour {\n    // Skip writing to new JSONL\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Archive File\nMove old closed issues to `issues-archive.jsonl`:\n- Not synced regularly\n- Available for historical queries\n- Main JSONL stays small\n\n### 4. Lazy Tombstone Handling  \nDon't write tombstones to JSONL at all - just remove the line:\n- Simpler, but loses cross-clone delete propagation\n- Would need different delete propagation mechanism\n\n## Recommendation\nStart with `bd compact` command - simple, explicit, user-controlled.\n\n## Related\n- gt-tnss: Analysis - Beads database size and hygiene strategy\n- gt-ox67: Maintenance - Regular cleanup of closed MR/gate beads\n\n## Workflow\n1.

Orphan vs Stale matrix (blocking × assigned dimensions)\n2. Graph pressure as staleness indicator (not time)\n3. Parallelism via absence of depends_on (default parallel, opt-in sequential)\n4. progress.Completed/Total are computed, not stored\n5. WaitsFor: all-children for dynamic fanout gates\n\n**Common pitfalls for agents:**\n- Thinking phases/steps imply sequence (NO - deps do)\n- Confusing protos with molecules\n- Temporal language inverting dependencies\n- Forgetting to squash/burn wisps\n\n**Consider splitting docs:**\n- molecules.md → conceptual overview\n- formulas.md → YAML syntax reference\n- lifecycle.md → pour/squash/burn/bond operations\n- patterns.md → Christmas Ornament, factory assembly, etc.\n\n## Workflow\n1.

This is wrong - formulas are reference documents describing a workflow, not templates to be instantiated into trackable work.\n\n## What Happened\n\n1. Formula exists at `.beads/formulas/mol-deacon-patrol.formula.toml`\n2. Deacon (or predecessor agent) created an epic + 9 task beads matching the formula steps\n3. These showed up in `bd ready` (separate bug filed)\n\n## Correct Model\n\n| Artifact | Purpose | Created How |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| Formula (.toml) | Reference doc describing workflow | Manual/design |\n| Wisp | Ephemeral execution context | `bd wisp create` (no child beads) |\n| Proto | Template for pour | `bd cook` from formula |\n\n**Formulas should NOT create beads.** They're documentation. When the Deacon runs a patrol, it follows the formula instructions directly - it doesn't need beads for each step.\n\n## Fix Needed\n\n1. Update Deacon template to clarify: \"Follow the formula instructions. Do not create beads from formula steps.\"\n2. Audit what command created the beads - was it `bd wisp create` expanding the formula? If so, that command shouldn't create child beads.\n3.

Added cross-database\nsupport to bd mol run: --template-db flag + auto-discovery when --db contains\n.beads-wisp. Commits pushed to both beads and gastown repos.\n\n## Open Design Discussion: Wisp Instance Decisions\n\nStarted discussing: How do we know when to spawn as wisp vs main DB?\n\n### Key Insight (from overseer)\nThe decision is NOT intrinsic to the proto. Protos are patterns/structure.\nWisp vs main is an orchestrator-level decision based on usage context.\n\nSame proto could spawn:\n- Wisp: routine operation, ephemeral\n- Persistent: debugging, audit trail needed\n\n### Current Implementation\n- gt sling hardcodes IsWisp=true for patrol roles\n- --wisp flag for manual override\n- bd mol run accepts --db to select storage\n\nThis is directionally correct - orchestrator (gt) decides, not data layer (beads).\n\n### Needs Deeper Thought\n1. Polymorphic bond operator - how does molecule composition affect this?\n2. Decision criteria - when/why does orchestrator choose wisp vs main?\n3. Digest lifecycle - how do wisps get squashed to digests?\n4. Other ephemeral patterns - polecat work harness, session wrappers, etc.\n\n### Files Changed This Session\n- beads: cmd/bd/mol_run.go (--template-db, auto-discovery)\n- gastown: internal/cmd/sling.go (IsWisp=true for patrols)\n\nThe architectural question is: what is the right abstraction for the\norchestrator to express this spawned instance is operational scaffolding,\nnot substantive work?","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T17:07:47.52254-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.404578-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:26:57.404578-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"message"}

FlushManager schedules async JSONL export\n3. Subprocess exits BEFORE flush completes\n4. `syncBeads()` runs `bd sync` which imports from JSONL\n5. JSONL doesn't have pinned field → SQLite gets overwritten with pinned=0\n\n### Fix Options (pick one)\n1. **Easiest**: In slingToCrew(), don't call syncBeads() after pinToHook()\n2. **Better**: Make beads.Pin() call `bd --no-daemon pin --sync` (if that flag exists)\n3. **Best**: Add explicit flush/sync call in Pin() before returning\n\n### Files to modify\n- gastown: internal/cmd/sling.go (slingToCrew around line 640)\n- OR gastown: internal/beads/beads.go (Pin method around line 393)\n\n### Test reproduction\n```bash\nbd create \"test pin\" --json\ngt sling \u003cid\u003e gastown/crew/max --force\nbd show \u003cid\u003e --json | jq '.[0].pinned'  # Should be true, is null\n```\n\n### Workaround in place\nAttachMolecule() on handoff bead is the primary mechanism.

{"id":"hq-ym1i","title":"📋 Work Assignment: bd pin: pinned field overwritten by subsequent bd commands","description":"Issue: bd-phtv\nTitle: bd pin: pinned field overwritten by subsequent bd commands\nPriority: P1\nType: bug\n\nDescription:\n## Summary\n\nThe `bd pin` command correctly sets `pinned=1` in SQLite, but any subsequent `bd` command (including read-only commands like `bd show`) resets `pinned` to 0.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n```bash\nbd --no-daemon pin \u003cissue-id\u003e --for=max\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\\\"\u003cissue-id\u003e\\\"\"\n# Shows pinned=1 ✓\n\nbd --no-daemon show \u003cissue-id\u003e --json\nsqlite3 .beads/beads.db \"SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\\\"\u003cissue-id\u003e\\\"\"\n# Shows pinned=0 ✗ WRONG\n```\n\n## Root Cause Investigation\n\n### Prime Suspects\n\n1. **JSONL import overwrites DB** - The `pinned` field has `omitempty` so false values arent in JSONL. When JSONL is imported, it overwrites the DB pinned=1 with default pinned=0.\n\n2. **Files to check:**\n   - `internal/importer/importer.go` - ImportIssue() may unconditionally set all fields\n   - `internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go` - UpsertIssue() may not preserve pinned\n   - `cmd/bd/main.go` - ensureStoreActive() may trigger import\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n```bash\n# Add debug logging to track what is writing pinned=0\ngrep -rn \"pinned\" internal/storage/sqlite/*.go\ngrep -rn \"Pinned\" internal/importer/*.go\n```\n\n## Likely Fix\n\nIn `internal/importer/importer.go` or `internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go`:\n\n```go\n// When upserting from JSONL, preserve pinned field if already set\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) UpsertIssue(ctx context.Context, issue *types.Issue) error {\n    // Check if issue exists and is pinned\n    existing, _ := s.GetIssue(ctx, issue.ID)\n    if existing != nil \u0026\u0026 existing.Pinned \u0026\u0026 !issue.Pinned {\n        // Preserve existing pinned status\n        issue.Pinned = existing.Pinned\n    }\n    // ... rest of upsert\n}\n```\n\nOR the import should skip fields that are omitempty and not present in JSONL:\n\n```go\n// In importer, only update fields that are explicitly set in JSONL\n// Pinned with omitempty means absent = dont change, not absent = false\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# After fix:\nbd --no-daemon pin \u003cissue-id\u003e --for=max\nbd --no-daemon show \u003cissue-id\u003e --json  # Should not reset pinned\nbd list --pinned  # Should show the pinned issue\nbd hook --agent max  # Should show pinned work\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. **internal/importer/importer.go** - Preserve pinned on import\n2. **internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go** - UpsertIssue preserve pinned\n3. **Add test** in internal/importer/importer_test.go\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `bd pin` survives subsequent bd commands\n- `bd list --pinned` shows pinned issues\n- `bd hook --agent X` shows pinned work\n- Existing tests still pass\n\n## Workflow\n1. Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:03:09.716893-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}

{"id":"hq-zkuw","title":"📋 Work Assignment: Add bd doctor --fix flag to automatically repair issues","description":"Issue: bd-ykd9\nTitle: Add bd doctor --fix flag to automatically repair issues\nPriority: P2\nType: feature\n\nDescription:\nAdd bd doctor --fix flag to automatically repair detected issues.\n\n## Current State\n- Doctor checks return issues with \"Fix\" field containing fix instructions\n- No automatic fix execution\n- User must manually follow fix instructions\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Add --fix flag to doctor.go\n```go\n// In cmd/bd/doctor.go init()\ndoctorCmd.Flags().Bool(\"fix\", false, \"Automatically fix detected issues\")\ndoctorCmd.Flags().Bool(\"yes\", false, \"Skip confirmation prompts (use with --fix)\")\n```\n\n### 2. Create fix registry (cmd/bd/doctor/fix/registry.go)\n```go\npackage fix\n\n// Fixer can automatically repair an issue\ntype Fixer interface {\n    // CanFix returns true if this fixer handles the given check name\n    CanFix(checkName string) bool\n    // Fix attempts to repair the issue, returns error if failed\n    Fix(ctx context.Context, issue *CheckResult) error\n    // Description returns human-readable description of what will be fixed\n    Description() string\n}\n\nvar registry []Fixer\n\nfunc Register(f Fixer) {\n    registry = append(registry, f)\n}\n\nfunc GetFixer(checkName string) Fixer {\n    for _, f := range registry {\n        if f.CanFix(checkName) {\n            return f\n        }\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Implement fixers (one per file)\n\n**cmd/bd/doctor/fix/hooks.go**\n```go\ntype HooksFixer struct{}\n\nfunc (f *HooksFixer) CanFix(name string) bool {\n    return name == \"git-hooks\" || name == \"hooks-outdated\"\n}\n\nfunc (f *HooksFixer) Fix(ctx context.Context, issue *CheckResult) error {\n    return hooks.Install(\".\", true) // force reinstall\n}\n\nfunc (f *HooksFixer) Description() string {\n    return \"Reinstall git hooks\"\n}\n\nfunc init() {\n    Register(\u0026HooksFixer{})\n}\n```\n\n**cmd/bd/doctor/fix/sync_branch.go**\n```go\ntype SyncBranchFixer struct{}\n\nfunc (f *SyncBranchFixer) CanFix(name string) bool {\n    return name == \"sync-branch-missing\" || name == \"sync-branch-diverged\"\n}\n\nfunc (f *SyncBranchFixer) Fix(ctx context.Context, issue *CheckResult) error {\n    // Reset to remote or create branch\n    return syncbranch.ResetToRemote(ctx, repoRoot, branch, jsonlPath)\n}\n```\n\n**cmd/bd/doctor/fix/merge_driver.go**\n```go\ntype MergeDriverFixer struct{}\n\nfunc (f *MergeDriverFixer) CanFix(name string) bool {\n    return name == \"merge-driver-missing\" || name == \"merge-driver-outdated\"\n}\n\nfunc (f *MergeDriverFixer) Fix(ctx context.Context, issue *CheckResult) error {\n    return setupMergeDriver()\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Update doctor run logic\n\n```go\nfunc runDoctor(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {\n    issues := runAllChecks()\n    \n    if \\!fixFlag {\n        // Existing behavior - just display issues\n        displayIssues(issues)\n        return\n    }\n    \n    // Collect fixable issues\n    var fixable []FixableIssue\n    for _, issue := range issues {\n        if fixer := fix.GetFixer(issue.CheckName); fixer \\!= nil {\n            fixable = append(fixable, FixableIssue{issue, fixer})\n        }\n    }\n    \n    if len(fixable) == 0 {\n        fmt.Println(\"No automatically fixable issues found\")\n        return\n    }\n    \n    // Show what will be fixed\n    fmt.Printf(\"Found %d fixable issues:\\n\", len(fixable))\n    for i, f := range fixable {\n        fmt.Printf(\"  %d.

Run `gt prime` to load polecat context\n2. Work on your task, commit changes regularly\n3. Run `bd close \u003cissue-id\u003e` when done\n4. Run `bd sync` to push beads changes\n5. Push code: `git push origin HEAD`\n6. Run `gt done` to signal completion\n\n## Handoff Protocol\nBefore signaling done, ensure:\n- Git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n- Issue is closed with `bd close`\n- Beads are synced with `bd sync`\n- Code is pushed to origin\n\nThe `gt done` command verifies these and signals the Witness.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T13:05:07.391629-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-24T19:17:02.1557-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"message"}
