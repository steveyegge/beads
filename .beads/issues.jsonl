{"id":"bd-drxs","title":"Make merge requests ephemeral wisps instead of permanent issues","description":"## Problem\n\nMerge requests (MRs) are currently created as regular beads issues (type: merge-request). This means they:\n- Sync to JSONL and propagate via git\n- Accumulate in the issue database indefinitely\n- Clutter `bd list` output with closed MRs\n- Create permanent records for inherently transient artifacts\n\nMRs are process artifacts, not work products. They exist briefly while code awaits merge, then their purpose is fulfilled. The git merge commit and GitHub PR (if applicable) provide the permanent audit trail - the beads MR is redundant.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nMake MRs ephemeral wisps that exist only during the merge process:\n\n1. **Create MRs as wisps**: When a polecat completes work and requests merge, create the MR in `.beads-wisp/` instead of `.beads/`\n\n2. **Refinery visibility**: This works because all clones within a rig share the same database:\n   ```\n   beads/              ← Rig root\n   ├── .beads/         ← Permanent issues (synced to JSONL)\n   ├── .beads-wisp/    ← Ephemeral wisps (NOT synced)\n   ├── crew/dave/      ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ├── polecats/*/     ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   └── refinery/       ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ```\n   The refinery can see wisp MRs immediately - same SQLite database.\n\n3. **On merge completion**: Burn the wisp (delete without digest). The git merge commit IS the permanent record. No digest needed since:\n   - Digest wouldn't be smaller than the MR itself (~200-300 bytes either way)\n   - Git history provides complete audit trail\n   - GitHub PR (if used) provides discussion/approval record\n\n4. **On merge rejection/abandonment**: Burn the wisp. Optionally notify the source polecat via mail.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Clean JSONL**: MRs never pollute the permanent issue history\n- **No accumulation**: Wisps are burned on completion, no cleanup needed\n- **Correct semantics**: Wisps are for \"operational ephemera\" - MRs fit perfectly\n- **Reduced sync churn**: Fewer JSONL updates, faster `bd sync`\n- **Cleaner queries**: `bd list` shows work items, not process artifacts\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Where MRs are created\n\nCurrently MRs are created by the witness or polecat when work is ready for merge. This code needs to:\n- Set `wisp: true` on the MR issue\n- Or use a dedicated wisp creation path\n\n### Refinery changes\n\nThe refinery queries for pending MRs to process. It needs to:\n- Query wisp storage as well as (or instead of) permanent storage\n- Use `bd mol burn` or equivalent to delete processed MRs\n\n### What about cross-rig MRs?\n\nIf an MR needs to be visible outside the rig (e.g., external collaborators):\n- They would see the GitHub PR anyway\n- Or we could create a permanent \"merge completed\" notification issue\n- But this is likely unnecessary - MRs are internal coordination\n\n### Migration\n\nExisting MRs in permanent storage:\n- Can be cleaned up with `bd cleanup` or manual deletion\n- Or left to age out naturally\n- No migration of open MRs needed (they'll complete under old system\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Auto-cleanup of closed MRs**: Keep MRs as permanent issues but auto-delete after 24h. Simpler but still creates sync churn and temporary JSONL pollution.\n\n2. **MRs as mail only**: Polecat sends mail to refinery with merge details, no MR issue at all. Loses queryability (bd-801b [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-bqcc\nbd-pvu0 [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-4opy\nbd-i0rx [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-ao0s\nbd-u0sb [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-uqfn\nbd-8e0q [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: beads-ocs\nbd-hvng [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-w193\nbd-4sfl [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-14ie\nbd-sumr [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-t4sb\nbd-3x9o [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-by0d\nbd-whgv [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-401h\nbd-f3ll [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-ot0w\nbd-fmdy [P3] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-kzda).\n\n3. **Separate merge queue**: Refinery maintains internal state for pending merges, not in beads at all. Clean but requires new infrastructure.\n\nWisps are the cleanest solution - they already exist, have the right semantics, and require minimal changes.\n\n## Related\n\n- Wisp architecture: \n- Current MR creation: witness/refinery code paths\n- bd-pvu0, bd-801b: Example MRs currently in permanent storage\nEOF\n)","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-23T01:39:25.4918-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T01:58:23.550668-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-23T01:58:23.550668-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Add new flags to `bd create`\n\n```go\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"body-file\", \"\", \"Read description from file (use - for stdin)\")\ncreateCmd.Flags().String(\"description-file\", \"\", \"Alias for --body-file\")\n```\n\n### 2. Flag precedence\n\n- If `--body-file` or `--description-file` is provided, read from file\n- If value is `-`, read from stdin\n- Otherwise fall back to `--body` or `--description` flag\n- If neither provided, description is empty (current behavior)\n\n### 3. Error handling\n\n- File doesn't exist → clear error message\n- File not readable → clear error message\n- stdin specified but not available → clear error message\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ **Matches training data**: `gh issue create --body-file file.txt` is a common pattern\n✅ **No shell escaping issues**: File content is read directly\n✅ **Works with any content**: Markdown, special characters, quotes, etc.\n✅ **Agent-friendly**: Agents already write complex content to temp files\n✅ **User-friendly**: Easier for humans too when pasting long descriptions\n\n## Related Commands\n\nConsider adding similar support to:\n- `bd update --body-file` (for updating descriptions)\n- `bd comment --body-file` (if/when we add comments)\n\n## Examples\n\n```bash\n# From file\nbd create --title=\"Add new feature\" --body-file=feature.md\n\n# From stdin\necho \"Quick description\" | bd create --title=\"Bug fix\" --body-file=-\n\n# With other flags\nbd create \\\n  --title=\"Security issue\" \\\n  --type=bug \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --body-file=security-report.md \\\n  --label=security\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Test with normal files\n- Test with stdin (`-`)\n- Test with non-existent files (error handling)\n- Test with binary files (should handle gracefully)\n- Test with empty files (valid - empty description)\n- Test that `--description-file` and `--body-file` are equivalent aliases","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-22T00:02:08.762684-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:13:40.536024-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T17:28:52.505239-08:00"}

Switch issue file I/O to write TOON format instead of JSONL\n   - Update cmd/bdt/storage.go to use EncodeTOON for writing\n   - Update cmd/bdt/storage.go to decode TOON (currently decodes JSON)\n   - Ensure round-trip: write TOON → read TOON → write TOON is byte-identical\n\n2. Update command implementations\n   - cmd/bdt/create.go: Write newly created issues to TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/list.go: Read issues from TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/show.go: Read from TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/import.go: Convert imported JSONL to TOON\n   - cmd/bdt/export.go: Export TOON to JSONL (for bd compatibility)\n\n3.

Git merge driver optimization\n   - TOON is line-oriented, better for 3-way merges than binary formats\n   - Configure git merge driver for .toon files\n\n5. Comprehensive testing\n   - Round-trip tests: Issue → TOON → storage → read → Issue\n   - Merge conflict resolution tests with TOON format\n   - Large issue set performance tests\n\n## Success Criteria\n- issues.toon stores actual TOON format (not JSONL)\n- bdt list reads from TOON file\n- bdt create writes to TOON file\n- Round-trip: create issue → list → show returns identical data\n- All 65+ tests still passing\n- Performance comparable to JSONL storage","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-19T14:05:41.394964404-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-19T14:37:17.879612634-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-19T14:37:17.879612634-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-iq7n","title":"Audit and fix JSONL filename mismatches across all repo clones","description":"## Problem\n\nMultiple clones of repos are configured with different JSONL filenames (issues.jsonl vs beads.jsonl), causing:\n1. JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T23:13:40.531403-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-17T16:50:59.510972-08:00"}

This causes ghost issues to resurrect even when tombstones exist.\n\nRoot cause: Git 3-way merge doesn't understand tombstone semantics. If base had closed, local changed to tombstone, and remote has closed, git might keep remote's version.\n\nThe early tombstone check in importer.go only prevents CREATION when tombstones exist in DB. But if applyDeletionsFromMerge hard-deletes the tombstones before import runs (because they're not in the merged result), the check doesn't help.\n\nPotential fixes:\n1. Make tombstones 'win' in the beads merge driver (internal/merge/merge.go)\n2. Don't hard-delete tombstones in applyDeletionsFromMerge if they're in the DB\n3.

This causes removed dependencies to be resurrected.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n```go\n// Current code (lines 795-816):\nfunc mergeDependencies(left, right []Dependency) []Dependency {\n    // Just unions left + right\n    // NEVER REMOVES anything\n    // Doesn't even look at base!\n}\n```\n\nAnd `mergeIssue` (line 579) doesn't pass `base`:\n```go\nresult.Dependencies = mergeDependencies(left.Dependencies, right.Dependencies)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nIf:\n- Base has dependency D\n- Left removes D (intentional)\n- Right still has D (stale)\n\nCurrent: D is in result (resurrection!)\nCorrect: Left removed it, D should NOT be in result\n\nThis breaks Gas Town's workflow and data integrity. Closed means closed.\n\n### Fix\n\nChange `mergeDependencies` to take `base` and do proper 3-way merge:\n- If dep was in base and removed by left → exclude (left wins)\n- If dep was in base and removed by right → exclude (right wins)\n- If dep wasn't in base and added by either → include\n- If dep was in base and both still have it → include\n\nKey principle: **REMOVALS ARE AUTHORITATIVE**\n\n### Files to Change\n\n1. internal/merge/merge.go:\n   - `mergeDependencies(left, right)` → `mergeDependencies(base, left, right)`\n   - `mergeIssue` line 579: pass `base.Dependencies`\n\n### Related\n\nThis also explains why `ProtectLocalExportIDs` in importer is defined but never used - the protection was never actually implemented.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T23:15:54.475872-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00"}

This is a breaking change for MCP clients.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nBreaking change affects:\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from ready()\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from list()\n- Client code that accesses full Issue fields (description, design, acceptance_criteria, timestamps, dependencies, dependents)\n\n## Current Behavior\n- ready() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- list() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- show() still returns full `Issue` (good)\n\n## Considerations\n**Pros of current approach:**\n- Forces clients to use show() for full details (good for context efficiency)\n- Simple mental model (always use show for full data)\n- Documentation warns about this\n\n**Cons:**\n- Clients expecting list[Issue] will break\n- No graceful degradation option\n- No migration period\n\n## Potential Solutions\n1. Add optional parameter `full_details=false` to ready/list (would increase payload)\n2. Create separate tools: ready_minimal/list_minimal + ready_full/list_full\n3. Accept breaking change and document upgrade path (current approach)\n4.

Return the new epic ID\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **No YAML** - Templates are just Beads\n- **Use existing tools** - `bd show`, `bd edit`, `bd dep` work on templates\n- **Graph-native** - Dependencies are real Beads dependencies\n- **Simpler codebase** - Remove all the YAML parsing/workflow code\n- **Composable** - Templates can reference other templates\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. Delete the YAML workflow system code (revert recent push + remove existing workflow code)\n2. Design template marking convention (label? type? id prefix?)\n3. Implement `bd template create` or `bd clone --as-template`\n4. Implement `bd template instantiate \u003ctemplate-id\u003e --var key=value`\n5.
