Gas Town needs:\n1. Structured way for workers to request decisions (not just free-form escalation)\n2. Tiered routing (Deacon -\u003e Mayor -\u003e Overseer) instead of direct-to-human\n3. Integration with gates (timeout -\u003e escalate)\n4. Formalized patterns for all worker exit scenarios\n\n## Current State (what exists)\n\nThe escalation system is already partially built:\n\n- `gt escalate` command: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM severity\n- Creates bead tagged `escalation`\n- Sends mail to `overseer`\n- Mayor checks pending escalations on `gt prime`\n- Exit type `ESCALATED` for polecats\n- Event logging: `escalation_sent`\n\nSee: `gastown/docs/escalation.md`\n\n## What's Missing\n\n| Gap | Current | Proposed |\n|-----|---------|----------|\n| Tiered routing | Direct to overseer | Deacon -\u003e Mayor -\u003e Overseer |\n| Decision pattern | Free-form topic | Structured options in issue |\n| Categories | Just \"escalation\" tag | decision, help, blocked, failed, emergency |\n| Gate integration | None | Gate timeout -\u003e escalate |\n| Patrol integration | Ad-hoc | Formalized paths |\n\n## Design\n\n### Escalation Categories\n\n| Category | Description | Default Destination |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| `decision` | Multiple valid paths, need choice | Deacon -\u003e Mayor |\n| `help` | Need guidance/expertise | Deacon -\u003e Mayor |\n| `blocked` | Waiting on unresolvable dependency | Mayor |\n| `failed` | Unexpected error, can't proceed | Deacon |\n| `emergency` | Security/data integrity | Overseer (direct) |\n| `gate_timeout` | Gate didn't resolve in time | Deacon |\n| `lifecycle` | Worker stuck/needs recycle | Witness |\n\n### Extended Command\n\n```bash\n# Current (unchanged)\ngt escalate \"Something went wrong\"\ngt escalate -s CRITICAL \"Data corruption\"\n\n# New: Category-based\ngt escalate --type decision \"Which auth approach?\"\ngt escalate --type help \"Need architecture guidance\"\ngt escalate --type blocked \"Waiting on bd-xyz\"\ngt escalate --type failed \"Tests failing unexpectedly\"\ngt escalate --type emergency \"Security vulnerability found\"\n\n# New: Tiered routing\ngt escalate --to deacon \"Infra issue\"\ngt escalate --to mayor \"Cross-rig coordination needed\"\ngt escalate --to overseer \"Human judgment required\"\n\n# New: Structured decision\ngt escalate --type decision \\\n  --question \"Which authentication approach?\" \\\n  --options \"JWT tokens,Session cookies,OAuth2\" \\\n  --context \"Admin panel needs login\" \\\n  --issue bd-xyz\n```\n\n### Decision Pattern in Issues\n\nWhen `--type decision` is used, the issue is updated with structured format:\n\n```markdown\n## Decision Needed\n\n**Question:** Which authentication approach?\n\n| Option | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| A | JWT tokens |\n| B | Session cookies |\n| C | OAuth2 |\n\n**Context:** Admin panel needs login\n\n**Escalated by:** beads/polecats/obsidian\n**Escalated at:** 2026-01-01T15:00:00Z\n\n**To resolve:**\n1.

An EV (Extended Validation) code certificate\n2. Integration with GoReleaser to sign Windows binaries during release\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Reduces false positive rates over time as the certificate builds reputation\n- Provides tamper verification for users\n- Improves SmartScreen trust rating on Windows\n- Professional appearance for enterprise users\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Acquire EV code signing certificate (annual cost ~$300-500)\n2. Set up signtool or osslsigncode in release pipeline\n3. Update .goreleaser.yml to sign Windows binaries\n4. Update checksums to include signed binary hashes\n5.

The valid placeholders are:\n- `%O` = base (common ancestor)\n- `%A` = current version (ours)\n- `%B` = other version (theirs)\n\n## Impact\n\n- Affects ALL users when they have `.beads/beads.jsonl` merge conflicts\n- Automatic JSONL merge fails with error: \"error reading left file: failed to open file: open 7: no such file or directory\"\n- Users must manually resolve conflicts instead of getting automatic merge\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `bd init` command (or wherever the merge driver is configured) is using non-standard placeholders.

Behavior:\n- bd create --ephemeral sets the flag\n- JSONL export SKIPS ephemeral issues (they never sync)\n- bd list shows all by default, --ephemeral / --persistent filters\n- bd mol squash clears the flag (promotes to permanent, now exports)\n- bd wisp gc deletes old ephemeral issues from the db\n- No separate directory, no separate routing\n\n## Migration\n\n1.

{"id":"bd-drxs","title":"Make merge requests ephemeral wisps instead of permanent issues","description":"## Problem\n\nMerge requests (MRs) are currently created as regular beads issues (type: merge-request). This means they:\n- Sync to JSONL and propagate via git\n- Accumulate in the issue database indefinitely\n- Clutter `bd list` output with closed MRs\n- Create permanent records for inherently transient artifacts\n\nMRs are process artifacts, not work products. They exist briefly while code awaits merge, then their purpose is fulfilled. The git merge commit and GitHub PR (if applicable) provide the permanent audit trail - the beads MR is redundant.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nMake MRs ephemeral wisps that exist only during the merge process:\n\n1. **Create MRs as wisps**: When a polecat completes work and requests merge, create the MR in `.beads-wisp/` instead of `.beads/`\n\n2. **Refinery visibility**: This works because all clones within a rig share the same database:\n   ```\n   beads/              ← Rig root\n   ├── .beads/         ← Permanent issues (synced to JSONL)\n   ├── .beads-wisp/    ← Ephemeral wisps (NOT synced)\n   ├── crew/dave/      ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ├── polecats/*/     ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   └── refinery/       ← Uses rig's shared DB\n   ```\n   The refinery can see wisp MRs immediately - same SQLite database.\n\n3. **On merge completion**: Burn the wisp (delete without digest). The git merge commit IS the permanent record. No digest needed since:\n   - Digest wouldn't be smaller than the MR itself (~200-300 bytes either way)\n   - Git history provides complete audit trail\n   - GitHub PR (if used) provides discussion/approval record\n\n4. **On merge rejection/abandonment**: Burn the wisp. Optionally notify the source polecat via mail.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Clean JSONL**: MRs never pollute the permanent issue history\n- **No accumulation**: Wisps are burned on completion, no cleanup needed\n- **Correct semantics**: Wisps are for \"operational ephemera\" - MRs fit perfectly\n- **Reduced sync churn**: Fewer JSONL updates, faster `bd sync`\n- **Cleaner queries**: `bd list` shows work items, not process artifacts\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Where MRs are created\n\nCurrently MRs are created by the witness or polecat when work is ready for merge. This code needs to:\n- Set `wisp: true` on the MR issue\n- Or use a dedicated wisp creation path\n\n### Refinery changes\n\nThe refinery queries for pending MRs to process. It needs to:\n- Query wisp storage as well as (or instead of) permanent storage\n- Use `bd mol burn` or equivalent to delete processed MRs\n\n### What about cross-rig MRs?\n\nIf an MR needs to be visible outside the rig (e.g., external collaborators):\n- They would see the GitHub PR anyway\n- Or we could create a permanent \"merge completed\" notification issue\n- But this is likely unnecessary - MRs are internal coordination\n\n### Migration\n\nExisting MRs in permanent storage:\n- Can be cleaned up with `bd cleanup` or manual deletion\n- Or left to age out naturally\n- No migration of open MRs needed (they'll complete under old system\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Auto-cleanup of closed MRs**: Keep MRs as permanent issues but auto-delete after 24h. Simpler but still creates sync churn and temporary JSONL pollution.\n\n2. **MRs as mail only**: Polecat sends mail to refinery with merge details, no MR issue at all. Loses queryability (bd-801b [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-bqcc\nbd-pvu0 [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-4opy\nbd-i0rx [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-ao0s\nbd-u0sb [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-uqfn\nbd-8e0q [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: beads-ocs\nbd-hvng [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-w193\nbd-4sfl [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-14ie\nbd-sumr [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-t4sb\nbd-3x9o [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-by0d\nbd-whgv [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-401h\nbd-f3ll [P2] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-ot0w\nbd-fmdy [P3] [merge-request] closed - Merge: bd-kzda).\n\n3. **Separate merge queue**: Refinery maintains internal state for pending merges, not in beads at all. Clean but requires new infrastructure.\n\nWisps are the cleanest solution - they already exist, have the right semantics, and require minimal changes.\n\n## Related\n\n- Wisp architecture: \n- Current MR creation: witness/refinery code paths\n- bd-pvu0, bd-801b: Example MRs currently in permanent storage\nEOF\n)","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-23T01:39:25.4918-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T01:58:23.550668-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-23T01:58:23.550668-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

{"id":"bd-gr4q","title":"Gate await fields cleared by auto-flush/auto-import cycle","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen creating a gate with `--await` fields (e.g., `gh:run:123`), the await_type and await_id are initially stored correctly in the SQLite database. However, they get cleared (set to empty strings) during subsequent bd commands due to the auto-flush/auto-import cycle.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a gate with await:\n   ```\n   bd gate create --molecule test-mol --await gh:run:20517738002\n   ```\n   Output shows correct `await_type: gh:run, await_id: 20517738002`\n\n2. Check database - fields are present\n\n3. Run any bd command (e.g., `bd list`)\n\n4. Check database again - await_type and await_id are now empty\n\n## Root Cause\n\nGates are wisps (ephemeral issues). During the auto-flush cycle:\n1. Auto-flush exports issues to JSONL (filtering out wisps)\n2. Auto-import reads JSONL and updates DB rows\n3. The update clears fields that weren't in the JSONL (including await fields)\n\n## Workaround\n\nUsing `--no-auto-import --no-auto-flush` flags preserves the fields, but this isn't practical for normal use.\n\n## Impact\n\nGitHub gate evaluation (`bd gate eval`) cannot work because by the time eval runs, the await fields have been cleared.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nEither:\n1. Don't clear await fields during auto-import if they weren't in the source\n2. Store wisp fields separately from the main JSONL export\n3. Include wisps in export but filter them at sync time","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-25T22:59:11.309657-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T23:20:20.33151-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-25T23:20:20.33151-08:00"}

Switch issue file I/O to write TOON format instead of JSONL\n   - Update cmd/bdt/storage.go to use EncodeTOON for writing\n   - Update cmd/bdt/storage.go to decode TOON (currently decodes JSON)\n   - Ensure round-trip: write TOON → read TOON → write TOON is byte-identical\n\n2. Update command implementations\n   - cmd/bdt/create.go: Write newly created issues to TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/list.go: Read issues from TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/show.go: Read from TOON format\n   - cmd/bdt/import.go: Convert imported JSONL to TOON\n   - cmd/bdt/export.go: Export TOON to JSONL (for bd compatibility)\n\n3.

JSONL files to be resurrected after deletion (one clone pushes issues.jsonl, another pushes beads.jsonl)\n2. Agents unable to see issues filed by other agents after sync\n3. Merge conflicts and data inconsistencies\n\n## Root Cause\n\nWhen repos were \"bd doctored\" or initialized at different times, some got issues.jsonl (old default) and others got beads.jsonl (Beads repo specific). These clones push their respective files, creating duplicates.\n\n## Task\n\nScan all repo clones under ~/src/ (1-2 levels deep) and standardize their JSONL configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Find all beads-enabled repos\n\n```bash\n# Find all directories named 'beads' at levels 1-2 under ~/src/\nfind ~/src -maxdepth 2 -type d -name beads\n```\n\n### Step 2: For each repo found, check configuration\n\nFor each directory from Step 1, check:\n- Does `.beads/metadata.json` exist?\n- What is the `jsonl_export` value?\n- What JSONL files actually exist in `.beads/`?\n- Are there multiple JSONL files (problem!)?\n\n### Step 3: Create audit report\n\nGenerate a report showing:\n```\nRepo Path                           | Config        | Actual Files           | Status\n----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------\n~/src/beads                         | beads.jsonl   | beads.jsonl            | OK\n~/src/dave/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl           | MISMATCH\n~/src/emma/beads                    | issues.jsonl  | issues.jsonl, beads.jsonl | DUPLICATE!\n```\n\n### Step 4: Determine canonical name for each repo\n\nFor repos that are the SAME git repository (check `git remote -v`):\n- Group them together\n- Determine which JSONL filename should be canonical (majority wins, or beads.jsonl for the beads repo itself)\n- List which clones need to be updated\n\n### Step 5: Generate fix script\n\nCreate a script that for each mismatched clone:\n1. Updates `.beads/metadata.json` to use the canonical name\n2. If JSONL file needs renaming: `git mv .beads/old.jsonl .beads/new.jsonl`\n3. Removes any duplicate JSONL files: `git rm .beads/duplicate.jsonl`\n4. Commits the change\n5. Syncs: `bd sync`\n\n### Expected Output\n\n1. Audit report showing all repos and their config status\n2. List of repos grouped by git remote (same repository)\n3. Fix script or manual instructions for standardizing each repo\n4. Verification that after fixes, all clones of the same repo use the same JSONL filename\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Handle repos without metadata.json (use default discovery)\n- Handle repos with no git remote (standalone/local)\n- Handle repos that are not git repositories\n- Don't modify repos with uncommitted changes (warn instead)\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- All clones of the same git repository use the same JSONL filename\n- No duplicate JSONL files in any repo\n- All configurations documented in metadata.json\n- bd doctor passes on all repos","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T23:58:35.044762-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T01:21:01.952723-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-25T01:21:01.952723-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

This causes ghost issues to resurrect even when tombstones exist.\n\nRoot cause: Git 3-way merge doesn't understand tombstone semantics. If base had closed, local changed to tombstone, and remote has closed, git might keep remote's version.\n\nThe early tombstone check in importer.go only prevents CREATION when tombstones exist in DB. But if applyDeletionsFromMerge hard-deletes the tombstones before import runs (because they're not in the merged result), the check doesn't help.\n\nPotential fixes:\n1. Make tombstones 'win' in the beads merge driver (internal/merge/merge.go)\n2. Don't hard-delete tombstones in applyDeletionsFromMerge if they're in the DB\n3.

This causes removed dependencies to be resurrected.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n```go\n// Current code (lines 795-816):\nfunc mergeDependencies(left, right []Dependency) []Dependency {\n    // Just unions left + right\n    // NEVER REMOVES anything\n    // Doesn't even look at base!\n}\n```\n\nAnd `mergeIssue` (line 579) doesn't pass `base`:\n```go\nresult.Dependencies = mergeDependencies(left.Dependencies, right.Dependencies)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nIf:\n- Base has dependency D\n- Left removes D (intentional)\n- Right still has D (stale)\n\nCurrent: D is in result (resurrection!)\nCorrect: Left removed it, D should NOT be in result\n\nThis breaks Gas Town's workflow and data integrity. Closed means closed.\n\n### Fix\n\nChange `mergeDependencies` to take `base` and do proper 3-way merge:\n- If dep was in base and removed by left → exclude (left wins)\n- If dep was in base and removed by right → exclude (right wins)\n- If dep wasn't in base and added by either → include\n- If dep was in base and both still have it → include\n\nKey principle: **REMOVALS ARE AUTHORITATIVE**\n\n### Files to Change\n\n1. internal/merge/merge.go:\n   - `mergeDependencies(left, right)` → `mergeDependencies(base, left, right)`\n   - `mergeIssue` line 579: pass `base.Dependencies`\n\n### Related\n\nThis also explains why `ProtectLocalExportIDs` in importer is defined but never used - the protection was never actually implemented.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T23:15:54.475872-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T23:21:10.709571-08:00"}

Instead, provide opt-in validation through multiple mechanisms.\n\n## Design\n\n### 1. `bd lint` command\n\nCheck issues for missing recommended sections:\n\n```bash\nbd lint              # Lint all open issues\nbd lint bd-xxx       # Lint specific issue\nbd lint --fix        # Interactive: prompt to add missing sections\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nbd-abc [bug]: Missing \"## Steps to Reproduce\"\nbd-def [task]: Missing \"## Acceptance Criteria\"\n\n2 issues with warnings\n```\n\n### 2. `--validate` flag on `bd create`\n\nOpt-in strict mode at creation time:\n\n```bash\nbd create -t bug --validate -d \"...\"  # Fails if missing required sections\nbd create -t bug -d \"...\"             # Succeeds (current behavior)\n```\n\n### 3. Section requirements by type\n\n| Type | Recommended Sections |\n|------|---------------------|\n| Bug | Steps to Reproduce, Acceptance Criteria |\n| Task/Feature | Acceptance Criteria |\n| Epic | Success Criteria |\n| Chore/Message | None |\n\nNote: \"Workaround\" dropped from GH#821 - not always applicable.\n\n### 4. Config option (future)\n\n```json\n// .beads/config.json\n{\n  \"validation\": {\n    \"on_create\": \"warn\" | \"error\" | \"none\",\n    \"on_sync\": \"warn\" | \"error\" | \"none\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Hook integration (future)\n\nPre-sync hook could run `bd lint` and warn/block based on config.\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n1. Add `RequiredSections()` to IssueType (internal/types)\n2.

This is a breaking change for MCP clients.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nBreaking change affects:\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from ready()\n- Any MCP client expecting `list[Issue]` from list()\n- Client code that accesses full Issue fields (description, design, acceptance_criteria, timestamps, dependencies, dependents)\n\n## Current Behavior\n- ready() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- list() returns `list[IssueMinimal] | CompactedResult`\n- show() still returns full `Issue` (good)\n\n## Considerations\n**Pros of current approach:**\n- Forces clients to use show() for full details (good for context efficiency)\n- Simple mental model (always use show for full data)\n- Documentation warns about this\n\n**Cons:**\n- Clients expecting list[Issue] will break\n- No graceful degradation option\n- No migration period\n\n## Potential Solutions\n1. Add optional parameter `full_details=false` to ready/list (would increase payload)\n2. Create separate tools: ready_minimal/list_minimal + ready_full/list_full\n3. Accept breaking change and document upgrade path (current approach)\n4.

When JSONL is imported, it overwrites the DB pinned=1 with default pinned=0.\n\n2. **Files to check:**\n   - `internal/importer/importer.go` - ImportIssue() may unconditionally set all fields\n   - `internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go` - UpsertIssue() may not preserve pinned\n   - `cmd/bd/main.go` - ensureStoreActive() may trigger import\n\n### Debug Steps\n\n```bash\n# Add debug logging to track what is writing pinned=0\ngrep -rn \"pinned\" internal/storage/sqlite/*.go\ngrep -rn \"Pinned\" internal/importer/*.go\n```\n\n## Likely Fix\n\nIn `internal/importer/importer.go` or `internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go`:\n\n```go\n// When upserting from JSONL, preserve pinned field if already set\nfunc (s *SQLiteStorage) UpsertIssue(ctx context.Context, issue *types.Issue) error {\n    // Check if issue exists and is pinned\n    existing, _ := s.GetIssue(ctx, issue.ID)\n    if existing != nil \u0026\u0026 existing.Pinned \u0026\u0026 !issue.Pinned {\n        // Preserve existing pinned status\n        issue.Pinned = existing.Pinned\n    }\n    // ... rest of upsert\n}\n```\n\nOR the import should skip fields that are omitempty and not present in JSONL:\n\n```go\n// In importer, only update fields that are explicitly set in JSONL\n// Pinned with omitempty means absent = dont change, not absent = false\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# After fix:\nbd --no-daemon pin \u003cissue-id\u003e --for=max\nbd --no-daemon show \u003cissue-id\u003e --json  # Should not reset pinned\nbd list --pinned  # Should show the pinned issue\nbd hook --agent max  # Should show pinned work\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. **internal/importer/importer.go** - Preserve pinned on import\n2. **internal/storage/sqlite/issues.go** - UpsertIssue preserve pinned\n3. **Add test** in internal/importer/importer_test.go\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `bd pin` survives subsequent bd commands\n- `bd list --pinned` shows pinned issues\n- `bd hook --agent X` shows pinned work\n- Existing tests still pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T12:32:20.046988-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T13:47:49.936021-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T13:47:49.936021-08:00","labels":["export:pinned-field-fix"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-phtv","depends_on_id":"bd-iz5t","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-23T12:44:07.140151-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"bd-r6a","title":"Redesign workflow system: templates as native Beads","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current workflow system (YAML templates in cmd/bd/templates/workflows/) is architecturally flawed:\n\n1. **Out-of-band data plane** - YAML files are a parallel system outside Beads itself\n2. **Heavyweight DSL** - YAML is gross; even TOML would have been better, but neither is ideal\n3. **Not graph-native** - Beads IS already a dependency graph with priorities, so why reinvent it?\n4. **Can't use bd commands on templates** - They're opaque YAML, not viewable/editable Beads\n\n## The Right Design\n\n**Templates should be Beads themselves.**\n\nA \"workflow template\" should be:\n- An epic marked as a template (via label, type, or prefix like `tpl-`)\n- Child issues with dependencies between them (using normal bd dep)\n- Titles and descriptions containing `{{variable}}` placeholders\n- Normal priorities that control serialization order\n\n\"Instantiation\" becomes:\n1. Clone the template subgraph (epic + children + dependencies)\n2. Substitute variables in titles/descriptions\n3. Generate new IDs for all cloned issues\n4. Return the new epic ID\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **No YAML** - Templates are just Beads\n- **Use existing tools** - `bd show`, `bd edit`, `bd dep` work on templates\n- **Graph-native** - Dependencies are real Beads dependencies\n- **Simpler codebase** - Remove all the YAML parsing/workflow code\n- **Composable** - Templates can reference other templates\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. Delete the YAML workflow system code (revert recent push + remove existing workflow code)\n2. Design template marking convention (label? type? id prefix?)\n3.

{"id":"bd-uu8p","title":"Routing bypassed in daemon mode","description":"## Bug\n\nPrefix-based routing (routes.jsonl) only works in direct mode. When the daemon is running, it bypasses routing logic because:\n\n1. Daemon mode resolves IDs via RPC (`daemonClient.ResolveID`)\n2. Daemon uses its own store, which only knows about local beads\n3. The routing logic in `resolveAndGetIssueWithRouting` is only called in direct mode\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\n# With daemon running:\ncd ~/gt\nbd show gt-1py3y  # Fails - daemon can't find it\n\n# With daemon bypassed:\nbd --no-daemon show gt-1py3y  # Works - uses routing\n```\n\n## Fix Options\n\n### Option A: Client-side routing detection (Recommended)\nBefore calling daemon RPC, check if the ID prefix matches a route to a different beads dir. If so, use direct mode with routing for that ID.\n\n```go\n// In show.go, before daemon mode:\nif daemonClient != nil \u0026\u0026 needsRouting(id) {\n    // Fall back to direct mode for this ID\n    result, err := resolveAndGetIssueWithRouting(ctx, store, id)\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Option B: Daemon-side routing\nAdd routing support to the daemon RPC server. More complex - daemon would need to:\n- Load routes.jsonl on startup\n- Open connections to multiple databases\n- Route requests based on ID prefix\n\n### Option C: Hybrid\nDaemon returns \"not found + prefix hint\", client retries with routing.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nOption A is simplest. The client already has routing logic; just use it when we detect a routed prefix.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-26T14:52:00.452285-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T14:54:51.572289-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T14:54:51.572289-08:00"}

This is the foundation for the \"Christmas Ornament\" pattern where a patrol\nmolecule grows arms per-polecat.\n\n## The Activity Feed Vision\n\nInstead of parsing agent logs, users see structured work state:\n\n```\n[14:32:08] + patrol-x7k.arm-ace bonded (5 steps)\n[14:32:08] + patrol-x7k.arm-nux bonded (5 steps)\n[14:32:09] → patrol-x7k.arm-ace.capture in_progress\n[14:32:10] ✓ patrol-x7k.arm-ace.capture completed\n[14:32:14] ✓ patrol-x7k.arm-ace.decide completed (action: nudge-1)\n```\n\nThis requires beads to track molecule step state transitions in real-time.\n\n## Key Primitives Needed\n\n### 1. Dynamic Bond with Variables\n```bash\nbd mol bond mol-polecat-arm \u003cparent-wisp-id\u003e \\\n  --var polecat_name=ace \\\n  --var rig=gastown\n```\n\nCreates wisp children under the parent:\n- parent-id.arm-ace\n- parent-id.arm-ace.capture\n- parent-id.arm-ace.assess\n- etc.\n\n### 2. WaitsFor Directive\n```markdown\n## Step: aggregate\nCollect outcomes from all dynamically-bonded children.\nWaitsFor: all-children\nNeeds: survey-workers\n```\n\nThe `WaitsFor: all-children` directive makes this a fanout gate - it can't\nproceed until ALL dynamically-bonded children complete.\n\n### 3. Activity Feed Query\n```bash\nbd activity --follow              # Real-time state stream\nbd activity --mol \u003cid\u003e            # Activity for specific molecule\nbd activity --since 5m            # Last 5 minutes\n```\n\n### 4. Parallel Step Detection\nSteps with no inter-dependencies should be flagged as parallelizable.\nWhen arms are bonded, their steps can run in parallel across arms.\n\n## Use Case: mol-witness-patrol\n\nThe Witness monitors N polecats where N varies at runtime:\n\n```\nsurvey-workers discovers: [ace, nux, toast]\nFor each polecat:\n  bd mol bond mol-polecat-arm \u003cpatrol-id\u003e --var polecat_name=\u003cname\u003e\naggregate step waits for all arms to complete\n```\n\nThis creates the Christmas Ornament shape:\n- Trunk: preflight steps\n- Arms: per-polecat inspection molecules\n- Base: cleanup after all arms complete\n\n## Design Docs\n\nSee Gas Town docs:\n- docs/molecular-chemistry.md (updated with Christmas Ornament pattern)\n- docs/architecture.md (activity feed section)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis epic may depend on:\n- Wisp storage (.beads-wisp/) - already implemented\n- Variable substitution in molecules - may need enhancement","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-23T02:32:43.173305-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-23T04:01:02.729388-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-23T04:01:02.729388-08:00"}

Currently wisps don't work properly in nodb mode.\n\n## Proposed Design\n\n### Phase 1: Session-scoped wisps\n- Memory storage already has Wisp field on Issue\n- Wisps exist only for the session lifetime\n- Acceptable for patrol cycles that complete within a session\n- Depends on: bd-9avq (fix the leak)\n\n### Phase 2: Optional wisp persistence\n- Add `.beads/wisps.jsonl` for wisp storage (gitignored)\n- Load wisps from this file on nodb startup\n- Save wisps to this file on nodb exit\n- Wisps persist across restarts but don't sync via git\n\n### Phase 3: Verify mol commands\n- Test mol squash, burn, bond work with memory storage\n- These currently check for SQLite storage type\n- May need interface-based approach instead of type assertions\n\n## Files affected\n- cmd/bd/nodb.go - wisp filtering and optional persistence\n- internal/storage/memory/ - verify wisp field handling\n- cmd/bd/mol_*.go - verify memory storage compatibility\n- .beads/.gitignore - add wisps.jsonl","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-24T21:15:59.658799-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T21:17:11.570958-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T21:17:11.570958-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-zy3z","depends_on_id":"bd-9avq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-24T21:16:04.649866-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
