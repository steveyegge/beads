We can't wait 8+ minutes every time we want to run tests.\n\n# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## 1. Sheer Volume\n279 tests is too many for a single package. Even at 0.1s per test, that's 28 seconds minimum just for cmd/bd.\n\n## 2. Each Test Creates Full Database + Temp Directories\nEvery test does heavy setup:\n- Creates temp directory (`t.TempDir()` or `os.MkdirTemp`)\n- Initializes SQLite database\n- Sets up git repo in many cases\n- Creates full storage layer\n\nExample from the tests:\n```go\nfunc setupCLITestDB(t *testing.T) string {\n    tmpDir := createTempDirWithCleanup(t)\n    runBDInProcess(t, tmpDir, \"init\", \"--prefix\", \"test\", \"--quiet\")\n    return tmpDir\n}\n```\n\nThis happens 279 times!\n\n## 3. Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","notes":"## Progress Update (2025-11-21)\n\n✅ **Completed**:\n- Audited all 280 tests, created TEST_SUITE_AUDIT.md ([deleted:bd-c49])\n- Refactored create_test.go to shared DB pattern ([deleted:bd-y6d])\n- Proven the pattern works: 11 tests now run in 0.04s with 1 DB instead of 11\n\n❌ **Current Reality**:\n- Overall test suite: Still 8+ minutes (no meaningful change)\n- Only 1 of 76 test files refactored\n- Saved ~10 DB initializations out of 280\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (REALISTIC)\n\nThis task is NOT complete until:\n- [ ] All P1 files refactored (create ✅, dep, stale, comments, list, ready)\n- [ ] Test suite runs in \u003c 2 minutes\n- [ ] Measured and verified actual speedup\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refactor remaining 5 P1 files: dep_test.go, stale_test.go, comments_test.go, list_test.go, ready_test.go\n2. Measure actual time improvement after each file\n3.

Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1. Verify the new content-hash based behavior is correct\n2. Check that the remapped issue (not necessarily local/remote) has the expected content\n3.

Every token in context has real costs:\n\n### Compute Cost\n- **Processing overhead**: Larger context = more GPU/CPU cycles per request\n- **Memory usage**: 10.5k tokens consume significant RAM/VRAM\n- **Scaling impact**: Multiplied across all users, all sessions, all requests\n\n### Energy \u0026 Environment\n- **Electricity**: More compute = more power consumption\n- **Carbon footprint**: Data centers running on grid power (not all renewable)\n- **Sustainability**: Unnecessary token usage contributes to AI's environmental impact\n- **Responsibility**: Efficient tools are better for the planet\n\n### User Experience\n- **Latency**: Larger context = slower processing (noticeable at 10k+ tokens)\n- **Cost**: Many AI services charge per token (input + output)\n- **Rate limits**: Context counts against API quotas\n\n### Engineering Excellence\n- **Efficiency**: Good engineering minimizes resource usage\n- **Scalability**: Efficient tools scale better\n- **Best practices**: Optimize for the common case\n\n**The comparison:**\n\n| Approach | Standing Context | Efficiency | User Cost | Environmental Impact |\n|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **CLI + hooks** | ~1-2k tokens | 80-90% reduction | Lower | Sustainable ✓ |\n| **MCP minimal** | ~2-4k tokens | 60-80% reduction | Medium | Better ✓ |\n| **MCP full** | ~10.5k tokens | Baseline | Higher | Wasteful ✗ |\n\n**Functional equivalence:**\n- CLI via Bash tool works just as well as MCP native calls\n- Same features, same reliability\n- No downside except initial learning curve\n\n## Hybrid Mode: Minimal MCP Surface Area\n\n**Philosophy:** MCP server doesn't have to expose everything.\n\nIf certain commands have legitimate UX/DX benefits from MCP (e.g., no approval prompts, cleaner syntax), we can expose ONLY those commands via MCP while using CLI for everything else.\n\n### Potential MCP-Only Candidates (TBD)\n\nCommands that might benefit from MCP native calls:\n- `ready` - frequently checked, no side effects, approval prompt annoying\n- `show` - read-only, frequently used, approval slows workflow\n- `list` - read-only, no risk, approval adds friction\n\nCommands that work fine via CLI:\n- `create` - complex parameters, benefits from explicit confirmation\n- `update` - state changes, good to see command explicitly\n- `close` - state changes, explicit is better\n- `dep` - relationships, good to see what's being linked\n- `sync` - git operations, definitely want visibility\n\n### Token Budget\n\n**Full MCP** (current): ~10.5k tokens\n- All ~20+ bd commands exposed\n- All parameter schemas\n- All descriptions and examples\n\n**Minimal MCP** (proposed): ~2-4k tokens\n- 3-5 high-frequency read commands only\n- Simplified schemas\n- Minimal descriptions\n- Everything else via CLI\n\n**Pure CLI**: ~1-2k tokens (only on SessionStart/PreCompact)\n- No MCP tools loaded\n- All commands via Bash\n\n### Investigation Required\n\nBefore implementing hybrid mode, validate:\n\n1. **Do MCP calls actually skip approval prompts?**\n   - Test with Claude Code approval settings\n   - Compare MCP tool calls vs Bash tool calls\n   - Measure UX difference in real usage\n\n2. **What's the actual token breakdown per command?**\n   - Measure individual command schemas\n   - Calculate token savings for minimal vs full\n\n3. **Is approval prompt the only benefit?**\n   - Are there other UX advantages to MCP?\n   - Does native syntax actually improve experience?\n   - User testing with both approaches\n\n4. **Can we dynamically load MCP tools?**\n   - Only load MCP when certain commands needed?\n   - Hot-swap between CLI and MCP?\n   - Probably not - MCP loads at startup\n\n### Hybrid Mode Documentation (If Validated)\n\n```markdown\n## Choosing Your Integration Approach\n\nBeads supports three AI agent integration approaches:\n\n### CLI + Hooks (Recommended - Most Efficient)\n\n**Setup:** `bd setup claude`\n\nUses Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context via `bd prime` command. Agent uses bd via Bash tool.\n\n**Tokens:** ~1-2k (on SessionStart/PreCompact only)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Maximum efficiency (80-90% reduction vs full MCP)\n- Lowest compute/energy usage\n- Same functionality as MCP\n\n**Cons:**\n- Bash tool calls may require approval prompts\n- Slightly more verbose in conversation\n\n### Minimal MCP + Hooks (Balanced)\n\n**Setup:** Install minimal MCP server (read-only commands) + `bd setup claude`\n\nExposes only high-frequency read commands via MCP (ready, show, list). Everything else via CLI.\n\n**Tokens:** ~2-4k MCP + ~1-2k hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- 60-80% reduction vs full MCP\n- No approval prompts for common queries\n- Cleaner syntax for frequent operations\n- Still efficient\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires MCP server (additional setup)\n- Mixed interface (some MCP, some CLI)\n\n### Full MCP + Hooks (Legacy)\n\n**Setup:** Install full MCP server + `bd setup claude`\n\n**Tokens:** ~10.5k MCP + hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- All commands as native function calls\n- Consistent interface\n\n**Cons:**\n- Highest token usage (worst for compute/energy/cost)\n- Slowest processing\n- Less sustainable\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. **Start with CLI + hooks** - most efficient, works great\n2. **Try minimal MCP** if approval prompts become annoying\n3. **Avoid full MCP** - wasteful with no significant benefit\n```\n\n## Production Validation Checklist\n\nBefore making these documentation changes, validate CLI approach works reliably:\n\n### Phase 1: Pure CLI Validation\n- [ ] `bd prime` implemented and tested\n- [ ] Hooks installed and working in Claude Code\n- [ ] Real-world usage by at least 2-3 developers for 1+ weeks\n- [ ] No significant usability issues reported\n- [ ] Agent successfully uses bd via Bash tool\n- [ ] Document which commands (if any) have approval prompt issues\n\n### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode Investigation (Optional)\n- [ ] Test if MCP calls skip approval prompts vs Bash calls\n- [ ] Measure token cost per MCP command\n- [ ] Identify minimal set of commands worth exposing via MCP\n- [ ] Build minimal MCP server variant\n- [ ] Validate token savings (should be 60-80% vs full MCP)\n- [ ] User testing shows actual UX improvement\n\n### Phase 3: Documentation Update\n- [ ] Update based on validation results\n- [ ] Include measured token counts (not estimates)\n- [ ] Provide clear migration paths\n- [ ] Update `bd doctor` recommendations\n\n## Migration Guide (Optional)\n\nFor users currently using MCP:\n\n```markdown\n### Migrating from Full MCP to CLI + Hooks\n\nAlready using full MCP server? You can switch to the more efficient CLI approach:\n\n1. Install hooks: `bd setup claude`\n2. Test it works (hooks inject context, agent uses Bash tool)\n3. Remove MCP server from `~/.claude/settings.json`\n4. Restart Claude Code\n\nYou'll get the same functionality with 80-90% less token usage.\n\n### Migrating to Minimal MCP (If Available)\n\nIf you find approval prompts annoying for certain commands:\n\n1. Replace full MCP with minimal MCP in `~/.claude/settings.json`\n2. Restart Claude Code\n3. Verify high-frequency commands (ready, show, list) work via MCP\n4. Everything else automatically uses CLI\n\nYou'll get 60-80% token reduction vs full MCP while keeping the UX benefits.\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `README.md` - Add recommendation in AI Integration section\n- `AGENTS.md` - Add \"Choosing Your Integration Approach\" section early\n- `QUICKSTART.md` - Update AI integration section\n- `docs/` - Any other AI integration docs if they exist\n- `mcp-server/` - Create minimal variant if hybrid validated\n\n## Future: Update `bd init`\n\nOnce validated, update `bd init` to:\n- Default to recommending `bd setup claude` (hooks only)\n- Mention minimal MCP as option for UX improvement\n- Detect existing full MCP and suggest migration\n- Provide token usage estimates for each approach\n\n## MCP Server Architecture Note\n\n**Key insight:** MCP server doesn't have to expose all bd functionality.\n\nCurrent design exposes ~20+ commands (all bd subcommands). This is over-engineered.\n\n**Better design:**\n- **Minimal MCP**: 3-5 read-only commands (~2-4k tokens)\n- **CLI**: Everything else via Bash tool\n- **Hooks**: Context injection via `bd prime`\n\nThis achieves best of both worlds:\n- Low token usage (efficient)\n- No approval prompts for common queries (UX)\n- Explicit visibility for state changes (safety)\n\nIf validation shows NO meaningful benefit to MCP (even minimal), skip hybrid mode entirely and recommend pure CLI.","acceptance_criteria":"- Documentation explains CLI + hooks as recommended approach\n- Explains why context size matters (compute/energy/cost/latency)\n- Token comparison table shows 80-90% reduction\n- Migration guide for existing MCP users\n- Only deployed AFTER production validation\n- Clear that both approaches are supported","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-12T00:15:25.923025-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-12T00:18:16.786857-08:00","source_repo":"."}
