The problem:\n1. Git operations (pull, merge, checkout) can restore old JSONL files\n2. Restored file has recent mtime (time of git operation)\n3. Auto-import sees \"newer\" JSONL and imports it\n4. Old data overwrites current database state\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 19:59: Commit 6cd3a32 restored JSONL to 538 issues from d99222d\n- 20:22: Commit 3520321 (bd sync)\n- 20:23: Commit 06d655a deleted 490 issues → JSONL now 48 lines\n- 20:23: User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id`\n- Migration completed, daemon started\n- Daemon saw JSONL (restored earlier to 538) was \"newer\" than database\n- Auto-import resurrected 490 deleted issues\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss bug** - user deletions can be undone silently\n- Affects any workflow that uses git branches, merges, or checkouts\n- Auto-import has no safety checks against importing older data\n- Users have no warning that old data will overwrite current state\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Content-based staleness** (not mtime-based)\n   - Compare JSONL content hash vs database content hash\n   - Only import if content actually changed\n   - Prevents re-importing old data with new mtime\n\n2. **Database timestamp check**\n   - Store \"last export timestamp\" in database metadata\n   - Only import JSONL if it's newer than last export\n   - Prevents importing old JSONL after git operations\n\n3. **User confirmation**\n   - Before auto-import, show diff of what will change\n   - Require confirmation for large changes (\u003e10% issues affected)\n   - Safety valve for destructive imports\n\n4. **Explicit sync mode**\n   - Disable auto-import entirely\n   - Require explicit `bd sync` or `bd import` commands\n   - Trade convenience for safety\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nCombination of #1 and #2:\n- Add `last_export_timestamp` to database metadata\n- Check JSONL mtime \u003e last_export_timestamp before importing\n- Add content hash check as additional safety\n- Show warning if importing would delete \u003e10 issues\n\nThis preserves auto-import convenience while preventing data loss.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136` - Auto-import logic\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go` - Daemon export/import cycle\n- `internal/autoimport/autoimport.go` - Staleness detection\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create and delete some issues, commit to git\n2. Checkout an earlier commit (before deletion)\n3. Checkout back to current commit\n4. JSONL file now has recent mtime but old content\n5. Run any bd command that triggers auto-import\n6.

Every token in context has real costs:\n\n### Compute Cost\n- **Processing overhead**: Larger context = more GPU/CPU cycles per request\n- **Memory usage**: 10.5k tokens consume significant RAM/VRAM\n- **Scaling impact**: Multiplied across all users, all sessions, all requests\n\n### Energy \u0026 Environment\n- **Electricity**: More compute = more power consumption\n- **Carbon footprint**: Data centers running on grid power (not all renewable)\n- **Sustainability**: Unnecessary token usage contributes to AI's environmental impact\n- **Responsibility**: Efficient tools are better for the planet\n\n### User Experience\n- **Latency**: Larger context = slower processing (noticeable at 10k+ tokens)\n- **Cost**: Many AI services charge per token (input + output)\n- **Rate limits**: Context counts against API quotas\n\n### Engineering Excellence\n- **Efficiency**: Good engineering minimizes resource usage\n- **Scalability**: Efficient tools scale better\n- **Best practices**: Optimize for the common case\n\n**The comparison:**\n\n| Approach | Standing Context | Efficiency | User Cost | Environmental Impact |\n|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **CLI + hooks** | ~1-2k tokens | 80-90% reduction | Lower | Sustainable ✓ |\n| **MCP minimal** | ~2-4k tokens | 60-80% reduction | Medium | Better ✓ |\n| **MCP full** | ~10.5k tokens | Baseline | Higher | Wasteful ✗ |\n\n**Functional equivalence:**\n- CLI via Bash tool works just as well as MCP native calls\n- Same features, same reliability\n- No downside except initial learning curve\n\n## Hybrid Mode: Minimal MCP Surface Area\n\n**Philosophy:** MCP server doesn't have to expose everything.\n\nIf certain commands have legitimate UX/DX benefits from MCP (e.g., no approval prompts, cleaner syntax), we can expose ONLY those commands via MCP while using CLI for everything else.\n\n### Potential MCP-Only Candidates (TBD)\n\nCommands that might benefit from MCP native calls:\n- `ready` - frequently checked, no side effects, approval prompt annoying\n- `show` - read-only, frequently used, approval slows workflow\n- `list` - read-only, no risk, approval adds friction\n\nCommands that work fine via CLI:\n- `create` - complex parameters, benefits from explicit confirmation\n- `update` - state changes, good to see command explicitly\n- `close` - state changes, explicit is better\n- `dep` - relationships, good to see what's being linked\n- `sync` - git operations, definitely want visibility\n\n### Token Budget\n\n**Full MCP** (current): ~10.5k tokens\n- All ~20+ bd commands exposed\n- All parameter schemas\n- All descriptions and examples\n\n**Minimal MCP** (proposed): ~2-4k tokens\n- 3-5 high-frequency read commands only\n- Simplified schemas\n- Minimal descriptions\n- Everything else via CLI\n\n**Pure CLI**: ~1-2k tokens (only on SessionStart/PreCompact)\n- No MCP tools loaded\n- All commands via Bash\n\n### Investigation Required\n\nBefore implementing hybrid mode, validate:\n\n1. **Do MCP calls actually skip approval prompts?**\n   - Test with Claude Code approval settings\n   - Compare MCP tool calls vs Bash tool calls\n   - Measure UX difference in real usage\n\n2. **What's the actual token breakdown per command?**\n   - Measure individual command schemas\n   - Calculate token savings for minimal vs full\n\n3. **Is approval prompt the only benefit?**\n   - Are there other UX advantages to MCP?\n   - Does native syntax actually improve experience?\n   - User testing with both approaches\n\n4. **Can we dynamically load MCP tools?**\n   - Only load MCP when certain commands needed?\n   - Hot-swap between CLI and MCP?\n   - Probably not - MCP loads at startup\n\n### Hybrid Mode Documentation (If Validated)\n\n```markdown\n## Choosing Your Integration Approach\n\nBeads supports three AI agent integration approaches:\n\n### CLI + Hooks (Recommended - Most Efficient)\n\n**Setup:** `bd setup claude`\n\nUses Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context via `bd prime` command. Agent uses bd via Bash tool.\n\n**Tokens:** ~1-2k (on SessionStart/PreCompact only)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Maximum efficiency (80-90% reduction vs full MCP)\n- Lowest compute/energy usage\n- Same functionality as MCP\n\n**Cons:**\n- Bash tool calls may require approval prompts\n- Slightly more verbose in conversation\n\n### Minimal MCP + Hooks (Balanced)\n\n**Setup:** Install minimal MCP server (read-only commands) + `bd setup claude`\n\nExposes only high-frequency read commands via MCP (ready, show, list). Everything else via CLI.\n\n**Tokens:** ~2-4k MCP + ~1-2k hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- 60-80% reduction vs full MCP\n- No approval prompts for common queries\n- Cleaner syntax for frequent operations\n- Still efficient\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires MCP server (additional setup)\n- Mixed interface (some MCP, some CLI)\n\n### Full MCP + Hooks (Legacy)\n\n**Setup:** Install full MCP server + `bd setup claude`\n\n**Tokens:** ~10.5k MCP + hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- All commands as native function calls\n- Consistent interface\n\n**Cons:**\n- Highest token usage (worst for compute/energy/cost)\n- Slowest processing\n- Less sustainable\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. **Start with CLI + hooks** - most efficient, works great\n2. **Try minimal MCP** if approval prompts become annoying\n3. **Avoid full MCP** - wasteful with no significant benefit\n```\n\n## Production Validation Checklist\n\nBefore making these documentation changes, validate CLI approach works reliably:\n\n### Phase 1: Pure CLI Validation\n- [ ] `bd prime` implemented and tested\n- [ ] Hooks installed and working in Claude Code\n- [ ] Real-world usage by at least 2-3 developers for 1+ weeks\n- [ ] No significant usability issues reported\n- [ ] Agent successfully uses bd via Bash tool\n- [ ] Document which commands (if any) have approval prompt issues\n\n### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode Investigation (Optional)\n- [ ] Test if MCP calls skip approval prompts vs Bash calls\n- [ ] Measure token cost per MCP command\n- [ ] Identify minimal set of commands worth exposing via MCP\n- [ ] Build minimal MCP server variant\n- [ ] Validate token savings (should be 60-80% vs full MCP)\n- [ ] User testing shows actual UX improvement\n\n### Phase 3: Documentation Update\n- [ ] Update based on validation results\n- [ ] Include measured token counts (not estimates)\n- [ ] Provide clear migration paths\n- [ ] Update `bd doctor` recommendations\n\n## Migration Guide (Optional)\n\nFor users currently using MCP:\n\n```markdown\n### Migrating from Full MCP to CLI + Hooks\n\nAlready using full MCP server? You can switch to the more efficient CLI approach:\n\n1. Install hooks: `bd setup claude`\n2. Test it works (hooks inject context, agent uses Bash tool)\n3. Remove MCP server from `~/.claude/settings.json`\n4. Restart Claude Code\n\nYou'll get the same functionality with 80-90% less token usage.\n\n### Migrating to Minimal MCP (If Available)\n\nIf you find approval prompts annoying for certain commands:\n\n1. Replace full MCP with minimal MCP in `~/.claude/settings.json`\n2. Restart Claude Code\n3. Verify high-frequency commands (ready, show, list) work via MCP\n4. Everything else automatically uses CLI\n\nYou'll get 60-80% token reduction vs full MCP while keeping the UX benefits.\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `README.md` - Add recommendation in AI Integration section\n- `AGENTS.md` - Add \"Choosing Your Integration Approach\" section early\n- `QUICKSTART.md` - Update AI integration section\n- `docs/` - Any other AI integration docs if they exist\n- `mcp-server/` - Create minimal variant if hybrid validated\n\n## Future: Update `bd init`\n\nOnce validated, update `bd init` to:\n- Default to recommending `bd setup claude` (hooks only)\n- Mention minimal MCP as option for UX improvement\n- Detect existing full MCP and suggest migration\n- Provide token usage estimates for each approach\n\n## MCP Server Architecture Note\n\n**Key insight:** MCP server doesn't have to expose all bd functionality.\n\nCurrent design exposes ~20+ commands (all bd subcommands). This is over-engineered.\n\n**Better design:**\n- **Minimal MCP**: 3-5 read-only commands (~2-4k tokens)\n- **CLI**: Everything else via Bash tool\n- **Hooks**: Context injection via `bd prime`\n\nThis achieves best of both worlds:\n- Low token usage (efficient)\n- No approval prompts for common queries (UX)\n- Explicit visibility for state changes (safety)\n\nIf validation shows NO meaningful benefit to MCP (even minimal), skip hybrid mode entirely and recommend pure CLI.","acceptance_criteria":"- Documentation explains CLI + hooks as recommended approach\n- Explains why context size matters (compute/energy/cost/latency)\n- Token comparison table shows 80-90% reduction\n- Migration guide for existing MCP users\n- Only deployed AFTER production validation\n- Clear that both approaches are supported","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-12T00:15:25.923025-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-12T00:18:16.786857-08:00","source_repo":"."}
