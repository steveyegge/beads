{"id":"bd-khnb","title":"bd migrate --update-repo-id triggers auto-import that resurrects deleted issues","description":"**Bug:** Running `bd migrate --update-repo-id` can resurrect previously deleted issues from git history.\n\n## What Happened\n\nUser deleted 490 closed issues:\n- Deletion committed successfully (06d655a) with JSONL at 48 lines\n- Database had 48 issues after deletion\n- User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id` to fix legacy database\n- Migration triggered daemon auto-import\n- JSONL had been restored to 538 issues (from commit 6cd3a32 - before deletion)\n- Auto-import loaded the old JSONL over the cleaned database\n- Result: 490 deleted issues resurrected\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe auto-import logic in `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136`:\n```go\nif isJSONLNewer(jsonlPath) {\n    fmt.Println(\"→ JSONL is newer than database, importing first...\")\n    if err := importFromJSONL(ctx, jsonlPath, renameOnImport); err != nil {\n```\n\nThis checks if JSONL mtime is newer than database and auto-imports. The problem:\n1. Git operations (pull, merge, checkout) can restore old JSONL files\n2. Restored file has recent mtime (time of git operation)\n3. Auto-import sees \"newer\" JSONL and imports it\n4. Old data overwrites current database state\n\n## Timeline\n\n- 19:59: Commit 6cd3a32 restored JSONL to 538 issues from d99222d\n- 20:22: Commit 3520321 (bd sync)\n- 20:23: Commit 06d655a deleted 490 issues → JSONL now 48 lines\n- 20:23: User ran `bd migrate --update-repo-id`\n- Migration completed, daemon started\n- Daemon saw JSONL (restored earlier to 538) was \"newer\" than database\n- Auto-import resurrected 490 deleted issues\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Critical data loss bug** - user deletions can be undone silently\n- Affects any workflow that uses git branches, merges, or checkouts\n- Auto-import has no safety checks against importing older data\n- Users have no warning that old data will overwrite current state\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. **Content-based staleness** (not mtime-based)\n   - Compare JSONL content hash vs database content hash\n   - Only import if content actually changed\n   - Prevents re-importing old data with new mtime\n\n2. **Database timestamp check**\n   - Store \"last export timestamp\" in database metadata\n   - Only import JSONL if it's newer than last export\n   - Prevents importing old JSONL after git operations\n\n3. **User confirmation**\n   - Before auto-import, show diff of what will change\n   - Require confirmation for large changes (\u003e10% issues affected)\n   - Safety valve for destructive imports\n\n4. **Explicit sync mode**\n   - Disable auto-import entirely\n   - Require explicit `bd sync` or `bd import` commands\n   - Trade convenience for safety\n\n## Recommended Solution\n\nCombination of #1 and #2:\n- Add `last_export_timestamp` to database metadata\n- Check JSONL mtime \u003e last_export_timestamp before importing\n- Add content hash check as additional safety\n- Show warning if importing would delete \u003e10 issues\n\nThis preserves auto-import convenience while preventing data loss.\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `cmd/bd/sync.go:130-136` - Auto-import logic\n- `cmd/bd/daemon_sync.go` - Daemon export/import cycle\n- `internal/autoimport/autoimport.go` - Staleness detection\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create and delete some issues, commit to git\n2. Checkout an earlier commit (before deletion)\n3. Checkout back to current commit\n4. JSONL file now has recent mtime but old content\n5. Run any bd command that triggers auto-import\n6.

{"id":"bd-1rh","title":"cmd/bd test suite is absurdly slow - 279 tests taking 8+ minutes","description":"# Problem\n\nThe cmd/bd test suite is painfully slow:\n- **279 tests** in cmd/bd alone\n- Full suite takes **8+ minutes** to run\n- Even with the 16 slowest integration tests now tagged with `integration` build tag, the remaining tests still take forever\n\nThis makes the development loop unusable. We can't wait 8+ minutes every time we want to run tests.\n\n# Root Cause Analysis\n\n## 1. Sheer Volume\n279 tests is too many for a single package. Even at 0.1s per test, that's 28 seconds minimum just for cmd/bd.\n\n## 2. Each Test Creates Full Database + Temp Directories\nEvery test does heavy setup:\n- Creates temp directory (`t.TempDir()` or `os.MkdirTemp`)\n- Initializes SQLite database\n- Sets up git repo in many cases\n- Creates full storage layer\n\nExample from the tests:\n```go\nfunc setupCLITestDB(t *testing.T) string {\n    tmpDir := createTempDirWithCleanup(t)\n    runBDInProcess(t, tmpDir, \"init\", \"--prefix\", \"test\", \"--quiet\")\n    return tmpDir\n}\n```\n\nThis happens 279 times!\n\n## 3. Tests Are Not Properly Categorized\nWe have three types of tests mixed together:\n- **Unit tests** - should be fast, test single functions\n- **Integration tests** - test full workflows, need DB/git\n- **End-to-end tests** - test entire CLI commands\n\nThey're all lumped together in cmd/bd, all running every time.\n\n# What We've Already Fixed\n\nAdded `integration` build tags to 16 obviously-slow test files:\n- import_profile_test.go (performance benchmarking tests)\n- export_mtime_test.go (tests with time.Sleep calls)\n- cli_fast_test.go (full CLI integration tests)\n- delete_test.go, import_uncommitted_test.go, sync_local_only_test.go (git integration)\n- And 10 more in internal/ packages\n\nThese are now excluded from the default `go test ./...` run.\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n## Option 1: Shared Test Fixtures (Quick Win)\nCreate a shared test database that multiple tests can use:\n```go\nvar testDB *sqlite.SQLiteStorage\nvar testDBOnce sync.Once\n\nfunc getSharedTestDB(t *testing.T) storage.Storage {\n    testDBOnce.Do(func() {\n        // Create one DB for all tests\n    })\n    return testDB\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to implement, immediate speedup\n**Cons**: Tests become less isolated, harder to debug failures\n\n## Option 2: Table-Driven Tests (Medium Win)\nCollapse similar tests into table-driven tests:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct{\n        name string\n        args []string\n        want string\n    }{\n        {\"basic issue\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\"}, \"created\"},\n        {\"with description\", []string{\"create\", \"Test\", \"-d\", \"desc\"}, \"created\"},\n        // ... 50 more cases\n    }\n    \n    db := setupOnce(t) // Setup once, not 50 times\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            // test using shared db\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Dramatically reduces setup overhead, tests run in parallel\n**Cons**: Requires refactoring, tests share more state\n\n## Option 3: Split cmd/bd Tests Into Packages (Big Win)\nMove tests into focused packages:\n- `cmd/bd/internal/clitests` - CLI integration tests (mark with integration tag)\n- `cmd/bd/internal/unittests` - Fast unit tests\n- Keep only essential tests in cmd/bd\n\n**Pros**: Clean separation, easy to run just fast tests\n**Cons**: Requires significant refactoring\n\n## Option 4: Parallel Execution (Quick Win)\nAdd `t.Parallel()` to independent tests:\n```go\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Run this test concurrently with others\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Pros**: Easy to add, can cut time in half on multi-core machines\n**Cons**: Doesn't reduce actual test work, just parallelizes it\n\n## Option 5: In-Memory Databases (Medium Win)\nUse `:memory:` SQLite databases instead of file-based:\n```go\nstore, err := sqlite.New(ctx, \":memory:\")\n```\n\n**Pros**: Faster than disk I/O, easier cleanup\n**Cons**: Some tests need actual file-based DBs (export/import tests)\n\n# Recommended Approach\n\n**Short-term (this week)**:\n1. Add `t.Parallel()` to all independent tests in cmd/bd\n2. Use `:memory:` databases where possible\n3. Create table-driven tests for similar test cases\n\n**Medium-term (next sprint)**:\n4. Split cmd/bd tests into focused packages\n5. Mark more integration tests appropriately\n\n**Long-term (backlog)**:\n6. Consider shared test fixtures with proper isolation\n\n# Current Status\n\nWe've tagged 16 files with `integration` build tag, but the remaining 279 tests in cmd/bd still take 8+ minutes. This issue tracks fixing the cmd/bd test performance specifically.\n\n# Target\n\nGet `go test ./...` (without `-short` or `-tags=integration`) down to **under 30 seconds**.\n\n\n# THE REAL ROOT CAUSE (Updated Analysis)\n\nAfter examining the actual test code, the problem is clear:\n\n## Every Test Creates Its Own Database From Scratch\n\nLook at `create_test.go`:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens NEW SQLite connection\n                                                    // ← Runs migrations\n                                                    // ← Sets config\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDescription(t *testing.T) {\n    tmpDir := t.TempDir()                          // ← Creates ANOTHER temp dir\n    testDB := filepath.Join(tmpDir, \".beads\", \"beads.db\")\n    s := newTestStore(t, testDB)                   // ← Opens ANOTHER SQLite connection\n    // ... actual test (3 lines)\n}\n```\n\n**This happens 279 times!**\n\n## These Tests Don't Need Isolation!\n\nMost tests are just checking:\n- \"Can I create an issue with a title?\"\n- \"Can I create an issue with a description?\"\n- \"Can I add labels?\"\n\nThey don't conflict with each other. They could all share ONE database!\n\n## The Fix: Test Suites with Shared Setup\n\nInstead of:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate_BasicIssue(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n\nfunc TestCreate_WithDesc(t *testing.T) {\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")  // ← Expensive!\n    // test\n}\n```\n\nDo this:\n```go\nfunc TestCreate(t *testing.T) {\n    // ONE setup for all subtests\n    s := newTestStore(t, t.TempDir()+\"/db\")\n    \n    t.Run(\"basic_issue\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()  // Can run concurrently - tests don't conflict\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    t.Run(\"with_description\", func(t *testing.T) {\n        t.Parallel()\n        // test using shared `s`\n    })\n    \n    // ... 50 more subtests, all using same DB\n}\n```\n\n**Result**: 50 tests → 1 database setup instead of 50!\n\n## Why This Works\n\nSQLite is fine with concurrent reads and isolated transactions. These tests:\n- ✅ Create different issues (no ID conflicts)\n- ✅ Just read back what they created\n- ✅ Don't depend on database state from other tests\n\nThey SHOULD share a database!\n\n## Real Numbers\n\nCurrent:\n- 279 tests × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **8 minutes**\n\nAfter fix:\n- 10 test suites × (create dir + init SQLite + migrations) = **30 seconds**\n- 279 subtests running in parallel using those 10 DBs = **5 seconds**\n\n**Total: ~35 seconds instead of 8 minutes!**\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Group related tests** into suites (Create, List, Update, Delete, etc.)\n2. **One setup per suite** instead of per test\n3. **Use t.Run() for subtests** with t.Parallel()\n4. **Keep tests that actually need isolation** separate (export/import tests, git operations)\n\nThis is way better than shuffling tests into folders!","notes":"## Progress Update (2025-11-21)\n\n✅ **Completed**:\n- Audited all 280 tests, created TEST_SUITE_AUDIT.md (bd-c49)\n- Refactored create_test.go to shared DB pattern (bd-y6d)\n- Proven the pattern works: 11 tests now run in 0.04s with 1 DB instead of 11\n\n❌ **Current Reality**:\n- Overall test suite: Still 8+ minutes (no meaningful change)\n- Only 1 of 76 test files refactored\n- Saved ~10 DB initializations out of 280\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (REALISTIC)\n\nThis task is NOT complete until:\n- [ ] All P1 files refactored (create ✅, dep, stale, comments, list, ready)\n- [ ] Test suite runs in \u003c 2 minutes\n- [ ] Measured and verified actual speedup\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refactor remaining 5 P1 files: dep_test.go, stale_test.go, comments_test.go, list_test.go, ready_test.go\n2. Measure actual time improvement after each file\n3.
