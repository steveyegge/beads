Now it uses content-hash comparison (introduced in commit 2e87329), which produces different but deterministic results.\n\n## Example\nOld behavior: Issue with more references would be kept\nNew behavior: Issue with lexicographically lower content hash is kept\n\n## Solution\nUpdate each test to:\n1.

Every token in context has real costs:\n\n### Compute Cost\n- **Processing overhead**: Larger context = more GPU/CPU cycles per request\n- **Memory usage**: 10.5k tokens consume significant RAM/VRAM\n- **Scaling impact**: Multiplied across all users, all sessions, all requests\n\n### Energy \u0026 Environment\n- **Electricity**: More compute = more power consumption\n- **Carbon footprint**: Data centers running on grid power (not all renewable)\n- **Sustainability**: Unnecessary token usage contributes to AI's environmental impact\n- **Responsibility**: Efficient tools are better for the planet\n\n### User Experience\n- **Latency**: Larger context = slower processing (noticeable at 10k+ tokens)\n- **Cost**: Many AI services charge per token (input + output)\n- **Rate limits**: Context counts against API quotas\n\n### Engineering Excellence\n- **Efficiency**: Good engineering minimizes resource usage\n- **Scalability**: Efficient tools scale better\n- **Best practices**: Optimize for the common case\n\n**The comparison:**\n\n| Approach | Standing Context | Efficiency | User Cost | Environmental Impact |\n|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| **CLI + hooks** | ~1-2k tokens | 80-90% reduction | Lower | Sustainable ✓ |\n| **MCP minimal** | ~2-4k tokens | 60-80% reduction | Medium | Better ✓ |\n| **MCP full** | ~10.5k tokens | Baseline | Higher | Wasteful ✗ |\n\n**Functional equivalence:**\n- CLI via Bash tool works just as well as MCP native calls\n- Same features, same reliability\n- No downside except initial learning curve\n\n## Hybrid Mode: Minimal MCP Surface Area\n\n**Philosophy:** MCP server doesn't have to expose everything.\n\nIf certain commands have legitimate UX/DX benefits from MCP (e.g., no approval prompts, cleaner syntax), we can expose ONLY those commands via MCP while using CLI for everything else.\n\n### Potential MCP-Only Candidates (TBD)\n\nCommands that might benefit from MCP native calls:\n- `ready` - frequently checked, no side effects, approval prompt annoying\n- `show` - read-only, frequently used, approval slows workflow\n- `list` - read-only, no risk, approval adds friction\n\nCommands that work fine via CLI:\n- `create` - complex parameters, benefits from explicit confirmation\n- `update` - state changes, good to see command explicitly\n- `close` - state changes, explicit is better\n- `dep` - relationships, good to see what's being linked\n- `sync` - git operations, definitely want visibility\n\n### Token Budget\n\n**Full MCP** (current): ~10.5k tokens\n- All ~20+ bd commands exposed\n- All parameter schemas\n- All descriptions and examples\n\n**Minimal MCP** (proposed): ~2-4k tokens\n- 3-5 high-frequency read commands only\n- Simplified schemas\n- Minimal descriptions\n- Everything else via CLI\n\n**Pure CLI**: ~1-2k tokens (only on SessionStart/PreCompact)\n- No MCP tools loaded\n- All commands via Bash\n\n### Investigation Required\n\nBefore implementing hybrid mode, validate:\n\n1. **Do MCP calls actually skip approval prompts?**\n   - Test with Claude Code approval settings\n   - Compare MCP tool calls vs Bash tool calls\n   - Measure UX difference in real usage\n\n2. **What's the actual token breakdown per command?**\n   - Measure individual command schemas\n   - Calculate token savings for minimal vs full\n\n3. **Is approval prompt the only benefit?**\n   - Are there other UX advantages to MCP?\n   - Does native syntax actually improve experience?\n   - User testing with both approaches\n\n4. **Can we dynamically load MCP tools?**\n   - Only load MCP when certain commands needed?\n   - Hot-swap between CLI and MCP?\n   - Probably not - MCP loads at startup\n\n### Hybrid Mode Documentation (If Validated)\n\n```markdown\n## Choosing Your Integration Approach\n\nBeads supports three AI agent integration approaches:\n\n### CLI + Hooks (Recommended - Most Efficient)\n\n**Setup:** `bd setup claude`\n\nUses Claude Code hooks to inject workflow context via `bd prime` command. Agent uses bd via Bash tool.\n\n**Tokens:** ~1-2k (on SessionStart/PreCompact only)\n\n**Pros:**\n- Maximum efficiency (80-90% reduction vs full MCP)\n- Lowest compute/energy usage\n- Same functionality as MCP\n\n**Cons:**\n- Bash tool calls may require approval prompts\n- Slightly more verbose in conversation\n\n### Minimal MCP + Hooks (Balanced)\n\n**Setup:** Install minimal MCP server (read-only commands) + `bd setup claude`\n\nExposes only high-frequency read commands via MCP (ready, show, list). Everything else via CLI.\n\n**Tokens:** ~2-4k MCP + ~1-2k hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- 60-80% reduction vs full MCP\n- No approval prompts for common queries\n- Cleaner syntax for frequent operations\n- Still efficient\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires MCP server (additional setup)\n- Mixed interface (some MCP, some CLI)\n\n### Full MCP + Hooks (Legacy)\n\n**Setup:** Install full MCP server + `bd setup claude`\n\n**Tokens:** ~10.5k MCP + hooks\n\n**Pros:**\n- All commands as native function calls\n- Consistent interface\n\n**Cons:**\n- Highest token usage (worst for compute/energy/cost)\n- Slowest processing\n- Less sustainable\n\n### Recommendation\n\n1. **Start with CLI + hooks** - most efficient, works great\n2. **Try minimal MCP** if approval prompts become annoying\n3. **Avoid full MCP** - wasteful with no significant benefit\n```\n\n## Production Validation Checklist\n\nBefore making these documentation changes, validate CLI approach works reliably:\n\n### Phase 1: Pure CLI Validation\n- [ ] `bd prime` implemented and tested\n- [ ] Hooks installed and working in Claude Code\n- [ ] Real-world usage by at least 2-3 developers for 1+ weeks\n- [ ] No significant usability issues reported\n- [ ] Agent successfully uses bd via Bash tool\n- [ ] Document which commands (if any) have approval prompt issues\n\n### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode Investigation (Optional)\n- [ ] Test if MCP calls skip approval prompts vs Bash calls\n- [ ] Measure token cost per MCP command\n- [ ] Identify minimal set of commands worth exposing via MCP\n- [ ] Build minimal MCP server variant\n- [ ] Validate token savings (should be 60-80% vs full MCP)\n- [ ] User testing shows actual UX improvement\n\n### Phase 3: Documentation Update\n- [ ] Update based on validation results\n- [ ] Include measured token counts (not estimates)\n- [ ] Provide clear migration paths\n- [ ] Update `bd doctor` recommendations\n\n## Migration Guide (Optional)\n\nFor users currently using MCP:\n\n```markdown\n### Migrating from Full MCP to CLI + Hooks\n\nAlready using full MCP server? You can switch to the more efficient CLI approach:\n\n1. Install hooks: `bd setup claude`\n2. Test it works (hooks inject context, agent uses Bash tool)\n3. Remove MCP server from `~/.claude/settings.json`\n4. Restart Claude Code\n\nYou'll get the same functionality with 80-90% less token usage.\n\n### Migrating to Minimal MCP (If Available)\n\nIf you find approval prompts annoying for certain commands:\n\n1. Replace full MCP with minimal MCP in `~/.claude/settings.json`\n2. Restart Claude Code\n3. Verify high-frequency commands (ready, show, list) work via MCP\n4. Everything else automatically uses CLI\n\nYou'll get 60-80% token reduction vs full MCP while keeping the UX benefits.\n```\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `README.md` - Add recommendation in AI Integration section\n- `AGENTS.md` - Add \"Choosing Your Integration Approach\" section early\n- `QUICKSTART.md` - Update AI integration section\n- `docs/` - Any other AI integration docs if they exist\n- `mcp-server/` - Create minimal variant if hybrid validated\n\n## Future: Update `bd init`\n\nOnce validated, update `bd init` to:\n- Default to recommending `bd setup claude` (hooks only)\n- Mention minimal MCP as option for UX improvement\n- Detect existing full MCP and suggest migration\n- Provide token usage estimates for each approach\n\n## MCP Server Architecture Note\n\n**Key insight:** MCP server doesn't have to expose all bd functionality.\n\nCurrent design exposes ~20+ commands (all bd subcommands). This is over-engineered.\n\n**Better design:**\n- **Minimal MCP**: 3-5 read-only commands (~2-4k tokens)\n- **CLI**: Everything else via Bash tool\n- **Hooks**: Context injection via `bd prime`\n\nThis achieves best of both worlds:\n- Low token usage (efficient)\n- No approval prompts for common queries (UX)\n- Explicit visibility for state changes (safety)\n\nIf validation shows NO meaningful benefit to MCP (even minimal), skip hybrid mode entirely and recommend pure CLI.","acceptance_criteria":"- Documentation explains CLI + hooks as recommended approach\n- Explains why context size matters (compute/energy/cost/latency)\n- Token comparison table shows 80-90% reduction\n- Migration guide for existing MCP users\n- Only deployed AFTER production validation\n- Clear that both approaches are supported","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-12T00:15:25.923025-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-12T00:18:16.786857-08:00","source_repo":"."}
