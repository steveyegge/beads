# Beads Release Formula v2 (Gate-Aware)
#
# This formula uses gates for async waits during CI, enabling clean phase handoffs.
# Instead of polling, the polecat completes Phase 1, and a gate blocks Phase 2
# until GitHub Actions finishes.
#
# Phases:
#   1. Prep & Push: preflight → push-tag (polecat work)
#   2. Gate: await-ci (async wait for release.yml)
#   3. Verify: verify-github, verify-npm, verify-pypi (parallel)
#   4. Install: local-install → release-complete (fan-in)

Beads release workflow v2 - gate-aware async release.

This formula orchestrates a complete release cycle with async gates:

Phase 1 (Polecat Work):
  1. Preflight checks (clean git, up to date)
  2. Documentation updates (CHANGELOG, info.go)
  3. Version bump (all components)
  4. Git operations (commit, tag, push)

Gate (Async Wait):
  5. await-ci: Gate on GitHub Actions release.yml completion

Phase 2 (Parallel Verification):
  6. Verify GitHub release, npm package, PyPI package (concurrent)

Phase 3 (Installation):
  7. Local installation update
  8. Daemon restart

## Usage

```bash
bd mol wisp create beads-release --var version=0.44.0
```

Or assign to a polecat:
```bash
gt sling beads/polecats/p1 --formula beads-release --var version=0.44.0
```

The polecat will complete Phase 1, then signal phase-complete. The gate blocks
until release.yml finishes. A new polecat (or the same one) resumes for Phases 2-3.
