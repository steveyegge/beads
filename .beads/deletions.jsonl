Appends (or creates) AGENTS.md with beads workflow instructions\n2. Includes command examples, issue types, priorities, and workflow\n3. Adds note to CLAUDE.md if it exists, directing agents to use beads\n4. Makes it clear agents should abandon markdown TODOs in favor of bd\n5. Idempotent - safe to run multiple times\n\nThe onboarding content should emphasize:\n- Use bd for ALL task tracking, not markdown TODOs\n- How to check ready work, create/update/close issues\n- When to use discovered-from dependencies\n- Priority and issue type conventions\n- Auto-sync behavior\n\nThis will reduce onboarding friction and prevent agents from creating parallel tracking systems.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-20T14:34:52.483607-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.254052-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T14:57:39.014109-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-179","title":"bd uses wrong default prefix when database filename indicates different prefix","description":"When creating issues without explicit --id flag, bd defaults to 'bd-' prefix even when the database filename and existing issues use a different prefix (e.g., 'wy-').","design":"## Bug Report\n\n**Environment:**\n- bd version: 0.9.11 (based on metadata)\n- Database: .beads/wy-.db\n- Directory: /Users/stevey/ai/flutter/wyvern\n\n**Observed Behavior:**\nWhen running `bd create task \"title\"` without --id flag, new issues get assigned `bd-*` IDs even though:\n- Database filename is `.beads/wy-.db` (implies wy- prefix)\n- All existing issues use `wy-*` prefix (wy-1 through wy-77)\n- No prefix metadata stored in database\n\n**Evidence:**\n```sql\nsqlite3 .beads/wy-.db \"SELECT * FROM issue_counters;\"\nwy|72\nbd|29\n```\n\nThe bd counter was incremented when I accidentally created bd-23 through bd-29 (now deleted).\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nbd should derive the default prefix from:\n1. Database filename (`wy-.db` → `wy-` prefix), OR\n2. Most recently used prefix in the database, OR  \n3. Prefix stored in metadata table\n\nAccording to `bd init --help`:\n\u003e -p, --prefix string   Issue prefix (default: current directory name)\n\nBut database filename convention appears to be `\u003cprefix\u003e.db`, so wy-.db should mean wy- is the intended prefix.\n\n**Workaround:**\nUse explicit `--id` flag: `bd create task \"title\" --id wy-73`\n\n**Reproduction:**\n```bash\n# In a directory with .beads/wy-.db containing wy-* issues\nbd create task \"test\"\n# Creates bd-* issue instead of wy-* issue\n```\n\n**Suggested Fix:**\n1. Store the intended prefix in metadata table during `bd init`\n2. When creating issues, check metadata for preferred prefix\n3. Fallback to extracting prefix from database filename\n4. Last resort: use directory name\n\n**Related Code:**\nLikely in issue counter/ID generation logic where new IDs are assigned.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-20T22:10:24.611471-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.264616-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T22:16:25.606694-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-19","title":"Implement storage driver interface for pluggable backends","description":"Create abstraction layer for storage to support multiple backends (SQLite, Postgres, Turso, in-memory testing, etc.).\n\n**Current state:** All storage logic hardcoded to SQLite in internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite.go\n\n**Proposed design:**\n\n```go\n// internal/storage/storage.go\ntype Store interface {\n    // Issue CRUD\n    CreateIssue(issue *Issue) error\n    GetIssue(id string) (*Issue, error)\n    UpdateIssue(id string, updates *Issue) error\n    DeleteIssue(id string) error\n    ListIssues(filter *Filter) ([]*Issue, error)\n    \n    // Dependencies\n    AddDependency(from, to string, depType DependencyType) error\n    RemoveDependency(from, to string, depType DependencyType) error\n    GetDependencies(id string) ([]*Dependency, error)\n    \n    // Counters, stats\n    GetNextID(prefix string) (string, error)\n    GetStats() (*Stats, error)\n    \n    Close() error\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Better testing (mock/in-memory stores)\n- Future flexibility (Postgres, cloud APIs, etc.)\n- Clean architecture (business logic decoupled from storage)\n- Enable Turso or other backends without refactoring everything\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n1. Define Store interface in internal/storage/storage.go\n2. Refactor SQLiteStore to implement interface\n3. Update all commands to use interface, not concrete type\n4. Add MemoryStore for testing\n5. Add driver selection via config (storage.driver = sqlite|turso|postgres)\n6. Update tests to use interface\n\n**Note:** This is valuable even without adopting Turso. Good architecture practice.\n\n**Context:** From GH issue #2 RFC evaluation. Driver interface is low-cost, high-value regardless of whether we add alternative backends.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.285248-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T23:46:22.447301-07:00"}

Had to manually run 'bd export' to sync.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Auto-export should trigger ~5 seconds after CRUD operations (per CLAUDE.md documentation).\n\n**Actual behavior:** Issues bd-33 and bd-17 were created but JSONL was not updated until manual 'bd export' was run.\n\n**Investigation needed:**\n1. Check if auto-flush goroutine is running\n2. Verify debounce timer is being triggered on CreateIssue()\n3. Check for errors/panics in background export\n4. Verify auto-flush is enabled by default\n5. Check if there's a race condition with shutdown\n\n**Impact:** HIGH - Data loss risk if users create issues and don't realize they haven't synced to Git.\n\n**Testing:**\n```bash\n# Create issue and wait 10 seconds\nbd create \"Test\" -p 4\nsleep 10\ngrep \"Test\" .beads/issues.jsonl  # Should find it\n```\n\n**Workaround:** Manually run 'bd export' after CRUD operations.\n\n**Context:** Discovered during GH issue #2 RFC evaluation while creating bd-33 and bd-17.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.303084-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-20T16:02:06.049244-07:00"}

Update VIEW to match GetReadyWork logic (complex CTE in a view)\n2. Drop the VIEW entirely if unused\n3. Make VIEW call GetReadyWork as a function (if SQLite supports it)\n\n**Investigation needed:**\nGrep for 'ready_issues' to see if the view is actually used.","notes":"**Investigation results:**\nGrepped the codebase - the ready_issues VIEW appears in:\n- schema.go (definition)\n- WORKFLOW.md, DESIGN.md (documentation)\n- No actual Go code queries it directly\n\n**Conclusion:** The VIEW is defined but appears UNUSED by actual code. GetReadyWork() function is used instead.\n\n**Recommended solution:** Drop the VIEW entirely to avoid confusion. It serves no purpose if unused and creates a maintenance burden (needs to stay in sync with GetReadyWork logic).\n\n**Alternative:** If we want to keep it for direct SQL access, update the VIEW definition to match the new recursive CTE logic.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.427372-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-14T13:06:47.739336-07:00"}

Verify depth limit prevents runaway recursion\n3. Measure performance impact of deep hierarchies\n4. Consider if 50 is the right limit (why not 100? why not 20?)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Most hierarchies are 2-5 levels deep\n- But pathological cases (malicious or accidental) could create 50+ level nesting\n- Need to ensure graceful degradation, not catastrophic failure\n\n**Implementation:**\nAdd TestDeepHierarchyBlocking to ready_test.go","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-16T20:46:08.971822-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.477933-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-18T16:47:05.347564-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-86","title":"Investigate CWD propagation from Claude Code/Amp to MCP server","description":"","design":"## Problem\n\nMCP servers don't know which directory the user is working in within Claude Code or Amp. This causes database routing issues for beads because:\n\n1. MCP server process starts with its own CWD (wherever it was launched from)\n2. `bd` binary uses tree-walking to discover databases based on CWD\n3. Without correct CWD, `bd` discovers the wrong database or falls back to ~/.beads\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nWe're using explicit `BEADS_DB` environment variables in MCP server configuration:\n- One MCP server per repo with explicit database path\n- Works but doesn't scale (30+ repos with .beads/ directories)\n\n## Desired Solution\n\nMCP server should receive CWD context either:\n\n### Option A: Startup Time\n- Claude Code/Amp passes working directory when launching MCP server\n- MCP server uses that directory for all tool calls\n- **Question:** Is this supported in MCP protocol/implementations?\n\n### Option B: Tool Call Time  \n- Each MCP tool call includes a `cwd` parameter\n- Tools use that CWD for subprocess execution\n- **Question:** Does MCP protocol support per-call context?\n\n### Option C: Hybrid\n- MCP server detects directory from Claude Code workspace/project\n- Tools accept optional `cwd` override parameter\n\n## Investigation Steps\n\n1. Review MCP protocol specification for context passing\n2. Check Claude Code MCP implementation for CWD handling\n3. Check Amp MCP implementation for CWD handling  \n4. Test if PWD environment variable is set correctly by Claude Code\n5. Prototype dynamic CWD detection in beads-mcp\n6. Document findings and recommend approach\n\n## References\n\n- beads-mcp already has `BEADS_WORKING_DIR` config support\n- bd_client.py uses `cwd` parameter for subprocess calls\n- Current implementation: `os.environ.get('PWD', os.getcwd())`\n","acceptance_criteria":"- Documented investigation findings\n- Tested CWD propagation in both Claude Code and Amp\n- Recommended approach for solving multi-repo MCP database routing\n- Prototype or proof-of-concept if feasible","notes":"## Implementation Complete (2025-10-17)\n\nImplemented PATH 1 (Simple Context Management) from the recommended solutions.\n\n### What Was Built\n\nAdded two new MCP tools to beads-mcp:\n\n1. **set_context(workspace_root)** - Sets workspace root and discovers database\n   - Resolves to git repo root automatically\n   - Walks up tree to find `.beads/*.db`\n   - Sets env vars: BEADS_WORKING_DIR, BEADS_DB, BEADS_CONTEXT_SET\n\n2. **where_am_i()** - Shows current context for debugging\n   - Returns workspace root, database path, actor\n\n3. **@require_context decorator** - Guards all write operations\n   - Only enforced when BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 env var is set\n   - Ensures context is set before create/update/close/reopen/dep/init\n   - Backward compatible (off by default)\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- File: `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py`\n- Tests: All existing tests pass (103/104)\n- Documentation: `integrations/beads-mcp/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md`\n\n### Key Discovery: Environment Variable Limitation\n\n**FastMCP architectural constraint:** Environment variables don't persist between tool calls in the current MCP protocol/FastMCP implementation.\n\nThis means:\n- `set_context` works within its own tool call\n- Subsequent tools may not see the env vars\n- True session state would require MCP protocol changes\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Partial solution delivered:**\n✅ Tools exist and work correctly\n✅ Can be used for explicit context management\n✅ Provides visibility (where_am_i)\n✅ Guards against accidental misrouting (when enabled)\n⚠️ Limited by MCP protocol's stateless nature\n\n**For production use:** Continue with current workaround (explicit BEADS_DB per MCP server config) until:\n1. MCP protocol adds session state support, OR\n2. We implement daemon RPC with per-request cwd (PATH 1.5), OR\n3. Client implementations can pass context with every tool call\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Immediate (keep current workaround):**\n- Use single MCP server with explicit BEADS_DB in config\n- Set BEADS_REQUIRE_CONTEXT=1 for safety\n- Call set_context at session start (even if env vars don't persist, it validates paths)\n\n**Medium-term (if needed):**\n- Implement PATH 1.5: Add cwd parameter to daemon RPC protocol\n- Update MCP server to use daemon client instead of direct CLI calls\n- Per-request context routing via daemon\n\n**Long-term (if \u003e50 repos):**\n- Implement PATH 2: Advanced routing daemon with repo→DB index\n\n## Original Notes\n[Previous investigation notes preserved above...]","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-17T02:06:09.737832-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.500889-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:54:35.196728-07:00"}

{"id":"bd-92","title":"Implement daemon RPC with per-request context routing (PATH 1.5)","description":"Enable MCP server to use daemon with per-request context instead of shelling out to bd CLI. This solves multi-repo routing properly.","design":"## Goal\n\nMCP server → daemon RPC with `cwd` parameter → daemon routes to correct database per request\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nAI Client (Claude/Amp)\n  ↓\nMCP Server (set_context sets workspace_root)\n  ↓\nDaemon Client Library (new)\n  ↓ RPC with cwd field\nbeadsd Daemon\n  ↓ tree-walking per request\nCorrect .beads/*.db\n```\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. Extend Daemon RPC Protocol\n**Files:** `internal/daemon/protocol.go`, daemon handlers\n\n- Add `Cwd string` field to all request types (CreateIssueRequest, UpdateIssueRequest, etc.)\n- Daemon does tree-walking to find `.beads/*.db` based on cwd\n- Each operation gets its own context (stateless per request)\n\n### 2. Create Daemon Client Library\n**New file:** `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/bd_daemon_client.py`\n\n- Python client for daemon RPC protocol\n- Methods matching current BdClient interface\n- Adds `cwd` parameter to all requests\n- Handles connection management, retries\n- Falls back to CLI if daemon unavailable\n\n### 3. Update MCP Server\n**File:** `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/server.py`\n\n- Store workspace_root from `set_context` \n- Use daemon client by default, fall back to CLI client\n- Pass workspace_root as cwd to all operations\n- Handle daemon not running gracefully\n\n### 4. Update bd_client.py\n**File:** `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/bd_client.py`\n\n- Make it an abstract interface/base class\n- Concrete implementations: BdCliClient, BdDaemonClient\n- Factory function to create appropriate client\n\n## Benefits\n\n- ✅ True multi-repo support (each request has context)\n- ✅ Better performance (no process spawning)\n- ✅ Concurrent access already solved (daemon exists)\n- ✅ Stateless per request (no env var persistence issues)\n- ✅ Falls back to CLI when daemon not running\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Extend RPC protocol** (Go)\n   - Add Cwd field to request structs\n   - Update daemon handlers to use cwd for tree-walking\n   \n2. **Create daemon client** (Python)\n   - Implement RPC protocol in Python\n   - Match BdClient interface\n   \n3. **Refactor MCP server**\n   - Abstract BdClient\n   - Use daemon client when available\n   \n4. **Test with multiple repos**\n   - Concurrent operations\n   - Context switching\n   - Daemon restart handling\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- bd-86: Root cause investigation (this is PATH 1.5 solution)\n- bd-91: Multi-server confusion (will be resolved)\n- bd-80, bd-81, bd-82, bd-83: Daemon implementation (foundation)","acceptance_criteria":"- MCP server can use daemon RPC instead of CLI\n- Each operation includes cwd context\n- Daemon routes to correct database per request\n- Works with multiple repos simultaneously\n- Falls back to CLI gracefully if daemon unavailable\n- All existing MCP tests pass\n- New multi-repo integration tests pass","notes":"## Progress: Session 2 (2025-10-17 continued)\n\n### Completed\n1. ✅ Updated MCP server to use daemon client\n   - Modified `tools.py` to use `create_bd_client()` factory\n   - Passes `BEADS_WORKING_DIR` from environment\n   - Uses daemon by default, falls back to CLI\n2. ✅ Added `BEADS_USE_DAEMON` environment variable\n   - Default: `1` (enabled)\n   - Set to `0` to force CLI mode\n3. ✅ Created multi-repo integration test (`test_multi_repo.py`)\n   - Tests concurrent operations across two repos\n   - Verifies proper database routing based on cwd\n   - Validates issue prefix isolation (r1- vs r2-)\n   - All tests pass! ✅\n4. ✅ Updated MCP README with daemon usage docs\n   - Added BEADS_USE_DAEMON to environment variables\n   - Added multi-repo test documentation\n\n### Test Results\n```\n=== All Tests Passed! ===\nSummary:\n  ✅ Per-request context routing works\n  ✅ Multiple repos are properly isolated\n  ✅ Concurrent operations succeed\n  ✅ Daemon handles rapid context switching\n```\n\n### Files Modified/Added (Session 2)\n- `integrations/beads-mcp/src/beads_mcp/tools.py` - uses daemon client ✅\n- `integrations/beads-mcp/test_multi_repo.py` - NEW integration test ✅\n- `integrations/beads-mcp/README.md` - daemon documentation ✅\n\n### Architecture Validated\n\n```\nAI Client (Claude/Amp)\n  ↓\nMCP Server (workspace_root from set_context)\n  ↓ create_bd_client(prefer_daemon=True, workspace_root)\nDaemon Client Library\n  ↓ RPC with cwd field\nbeadsd Daemon\n  ↓ per-request tree-walking\nCorrect .beads/*.db\n```\n\n### Ready to Close\nAll acceptance criteria met:\n- ✅ MCP server can use daemon RPC instead of CLI\n- ✅ Each operation includes cwd context\n- ✅ Daemon routes to correct database per request\n- ✅ Works with multiple repos simultaneously\n- ✅ Falls back to CLI gracefully if daemon unavailable\n- ✅ All existing MCP tests pass\n- ✅ New multi-repo integration tests pass","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-17T16:20:00.775954-07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T18:49:34.51145-08:00","closed_at":"2025-10-17T16:37:34.504057-07:00"}

For multi-repo support, add --global flag to create socket in ~/.beads/bd.sock that can serve requests from any repository.\n\nImplementation:\n- Add --global flag to daemon command\n- When --global is set, use ~/.beads/bd.sock instead of ./.beads/bd.sock  \n- Don't require being in a git repo when --global is used\n- Update daemon discovery logic to check ~/.beads/bd.sock as fallback\n- Document that global daemon can serve multiple repos simultaneously\n\nBenefits:\n- Single daemon serves all repos on the system\n- No need to start daemon per-repo\n- Better resource usage\n- Enables system-wide task tracking\n\nContext: Per-request context routing (bd-92) already implemented - daemon can handle multiple repos.
