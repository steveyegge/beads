# Changelog

All notable changes to the beads project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.2] - 2025-11-01

### Changed
- Homebrew formula now auto-published in main repo via GoReleaser
- Deprecated separate homebrew-beads tap repository

## [0.21.1] - 2025-10-31

### Changed
- Version bump for consistency across CLI, MCP server, and plugin

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-31

### Breaking Changes

- **Hash-Based IDs Now Default**: Sequential IDs (bd-1, bd-2) replaced with hash-based IDs (bd-a1b2, bd-f14c)
  - 4-character hashes for 0-500 issues
  - 5-character hashes for 500-1,500 issues  
  - 6-character hashes for 1,500-10,000 issues
  - Progressive length extension prevents collisions with birthday paradox math
  - **Migration required**: Run `bd migrate` to upgrade schema (removes `issue_counters` table)
  - Existing databases continue working - migration is opt-in
  - Dramatically reduces merge conflicts in multi-worker/multi-branch workflows
  - Eliminates ID collision issues when multiple agents create issues concurrently

### Removed

- **Sequential ID Generation**: Removed `SyncAllCounters()`, `AllocateNextID()`, and collision remapping logic (bd-c7af, bd-8e05, bd-4c74)
  - Hash IDs handle collisions by extending hash length, not remapping
  - `issue_counters` table removed from schema
  - `--resolve-collisions` flag removed from import (no longer needed)
  - 400+ lines of obsolete collision handling code removed

### Changed

- **Collision Handling**: Automatic hash extension on collision instead of ID remapping
  - Much simpler and more reliable than sequential remapping
  - No cross-branch coordination needed
  - Birthday paradox ensures extremely low collision rates

### Migration Notes

**For users upgrading from 0.20.0 or earlier:**

1. Run `bd migrate` to detect and upgrade old database schemas
2. Database continues to work without migration, but you'll see warnings
3. Hash IDs provide better multi-worker reliability at the cost of non-numeric IDs
4. Old sequential IDs like `bd-152` become hash IDs like `bd-f14c`

See README.md for hash ID format details and birthday paradox collision analysis.

## [0.9.1] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Incremental JSONL Export**: Major performance optimization
  - Dirty issue tracking system to only export changed issues
  - Auto-flush with 5-second debounce after CRUD operations
  - Automatic import when JSONL is newer than database
  - `--no-auto-flush` and `--no-auto-import` flags for manual control
  - Comprehensive test coverage for auto-flush/import
- **ID Space Partitioning**: Explicit ID assignment for parallel workers
  - `bd create --id worker1-100` for controlling ID allocation
  - Enables multiple agents to work without conflicts
  - Documented in CLAUDE.md for agent workflows
- **Auto-Migration System**: Seamless database schema upgrades
  - Automatically adds dirty_issues table to existing databases
  - Silent migration on first access after upgrade
  - No manual intervention required

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Race condition in dirty tracking (TOCTOU bug)
  - Could cause data loss during concurrent operations
  - Fixed by tracking specific exported IDs instead of clearing all
- **Critical**: Export with filters cleared all dirty issues
  - Status/priority filters would incorrectly mark non-matching issues as clean
  - Now only clears issues that were actually exported
- **Bug**: Malformed ID detection never worked
  - SQLite CAST returns 0 for invalid strings, not NULL
  - Now correctly detects non-numeric ID suffixes like "bd-abc"
  - No false positives on legitimate zero-prefixed IDs
- **Bug**: Inconsistent dependency dirty marking
  - Duplicated 20+ lines of code in AddDependency/RemoveDependency
  - Refactored to use shared markIssuesDirtyTx() helper
- Fixed unchecked error in import.go when unmarshaling JSON
- Fixed unchecked error returns in test cleanup code
- Removed duplicate test code in dependencies_test.go
- Fixed Go version in go.mod (was incorrectly set to 1.25.2)

### Changed
- Export now tracks which specific issues were exported
- ClearDirtyIssuesByID() added (ClearDirtyIssues() deprecated with race warning)
- Dependency operations use shared dirty-marking helper (DRY)

### Performance
- Incremental export: Only writes changed issues (vs full export)
- Regex caching in ID replacement: 1.9x performance improvement
- Automatic debounced flush prevents excessive I/O

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- **Collision Resolution System**: Automatic ID remapping for import collisions
  - Reference scoring algorithm to minimize updates during remapping
  - Word-boundary regex matching to prevent false replacements
  - Automatic updating of text references and dependencies
  - `--resolve-collisions` flag for safe branch merging
  - `--dry-run` flag to preview collision detection
- **Export/Import with JSONL**: Git-friendly text format
  - Dependencies embedded in JSONL for complete portability
  - Idempotent import (exact matches detected)
  - Collision detection (same ID, different content)
- **Ready Work Algorithm**: Find issues with no open blockers
  - `bd ready` command shows unblocked work
  - `bd blocked` command shows what's waiting
- **Dependency Management**: Four dependency types
  - `blocks`: Hard blocker (affects ready work)
  - `related`: Soft relationship
  - `parent-child`: Epic/subtask hierarchy
  - `discovered-from`: Track issues discovered during work
- **Database Discovery**: Auto-find database in project hierarchy
  - Walks up directory tree like git
  - Supports `$BEADS_DB` environment variable
  - Falls back to `~/.beads/default.db`
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - README.md with 900+ lines of examples and FAQs
  - CLAUDE.md for AI agent integration patterns
  - SECURITY.md with security policy and best practices
  - TEXT_FORMATS.md analyzing JSONL approach
  - EXTENDING.md for database extension patterns
  - GIT_WORKFLOW.md for git integration
- **Examples**: Real-world integration patterns
  - Python agent implementation
  - Bash agent script
  - Git hooks for automatic export/import
  - Branch merge workflow with collision resolution
  - Claude Desktop MCP integration (coming soon)

### Changed
- Switched to JSONL as source of truth (from binary SQLite)
- SQLite database now acts as ephemeral cache
- Issue IDs generated with numerical max (not alphabetical)
- Export sorts issues by ID for consistent git diffs

### Security
- SQL injection protection via allowlisted field names
- Input validation for all issue fields
- File path validation for database operations
- Warnings about not storing secrets in issues

## [0.1.0] - Initial Development

### Added
- Core issue tracking (create, update, list, show, close)
- SQLite storage backend
- Dependency tracking with cycle detection
- Label support
- Event audit trail
- Full-text search
- Statistics and reporting
- `bd init` for project initialization
- `bd quickstart` interactive tutorial

## Version History

- **0.9.8** (2025-10-16): Daemon mode, git sync, compaction, critical bug fixes
- **0.9.2** (2025-10-14): Community PRs, critical bug fixes, and --deps flag
- **0.9.1** (2025-10-14): Performance optimization and critical bug fixes
- **0.9.0** (2025-10-12): Pre-release polish and collision resolution
- **0.1.0**: Initial development version

## Upgrade Guide

### Upgrading to 0.9.8

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **bd daemon**: New optional background service for auto-sync workflows
- **bd sync**: New optional git integration command
- **bd compact**: New optional command for issue summarization (requires Anthropic API key)
- **--format flag**: Optional new feature for `bd list`
- **Label/title filters**: Optional new filters for `bd list`
- **Bug fixes**: All critical fixes are transparent to users

Simply pull the latest version and rebuild:
```bash
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
# or
git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

**Note**: The `bd compact` command requires an Anthropic API key in `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. All other features work without any additional setup.

### Upgrading to 0.9.2

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **--deps flag**: Optional new feature for `bd create`
- **external_ref**: Optional field, existing issues unaffected
- **Metadata table**: Auto-migrates on first use
- **Bug fixes**: All critical fixes are transparent to users

Simply pull the latest version and rebuild:
```bash
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
# or
git pull && go build -o bd ./cmd/bd
```

### Upgrading to 0.9.1

No breaking changes. All changes are backward compatible:
- **Auto-migration**: The dirty_issues table is automatically added to existing databases
- **Auto-flush/import**: Enabled by default, improves workflow (can disable with flags if needed)
- **ID partitioning**: Optional feature, use `--id` flag only if needed for parallel workers

If you're upgrading from 0.9.0, simply pull the latest version. Your existing database will be automatically migrated on first use.

### Upgrading to 0.9.0

No breaking changes. The JSONL export format is backward compatible.

If you have issues in your database:
1. Run `bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl` to create the text file
2. Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` to git
3. Add `.beads/*.db` to `.gitignore`

New collaborators can clone the repo and run:
```bash
bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl
```

The SQLite database will be automatically populated from the JSONL file.
