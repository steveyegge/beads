# bd Issue Tracking

## Overview

bd is a graph-based issue tracker for persistent memory across sessions. Use for multi-session work with complex dependencies; use TodoWrite for simple single-session tasks.

## When to Use bd vs TodoWrite

### Use bd when:
- **Multi-session work** - Tasks spanning multiple compaction cycles or days
- **Complex dependencies** - Work with blockers, prerequisites, or hierarchical structure
- **Knowledge work** - Strategic documents, research, or tasks with fuzzy boundaries
- **Side quests** - Exploratory work that might pause the main task
- **Project memory** - Need to resume work after weeks away with full context

### Use TodoWrite when:
- **Single-session tasks** - Work that completes within current session
- **Linear execution** - Straightforward step-by-step tasks with no branching
- **Immediate context** - All information already in conversation
- **Simple tracking** - Just need a checklist to show progress

**Key insight**: If resuming work after 2 weeks would be difficult without bd, use bd. If the work can be picked up from a markdown skim, TodoWrite is sufficient.

### Test Yourself: bd or TodoWrite?

Ask these questions to decide:

**Choose bd if:**
- ‚ùì "Will I need this context in 2 weeks?" ‚Üí Yes = bd
- ‚ùì "Could conversation history get compacted?" ‚Üí Yes = bd
- ‚ùì "Does this have blockers/dependencies?" ‚Üí Yes = bd
- ‚ùì "Is this fuzzy/exploratory work?" ‚Üí Yes = bd

**Choose TodoWrite if:**
- ‚ùì "Will this be done in this session?" ‚Üí Yes = TodoWrite
- ‚ùì "Is this just a task list for me right now?" ‚Üí Yes = TodoWrite
- ‚ùì "Is this linear with no branching?" ‚Üí Yes = TodoWrite

**When in doubt**: Use bd. Better to have persistent memory you don't need than to lose context you needed.

**For detailed decision criteria and examples, read:** [references/BOUNDARIES.md](references/BOUNDARIES.md)

## Surviving Compaction Events

**Critical**: Compaction events delete conversation history but preserve beads. After compaction, bd state is your only persistent memory.

**What survives compaction:**
- All bead data (issues, notes, dependencies, status)
- Complete work history and context

**What doesn't survive:**
- Conversation history
- TodoWrite lists
- Recent discussion context

**Writing notes for post-compaction recovery:**

Write notes as if explaining to a future agent with zero conversation context:

**Pattern:**
```markdown
notes field format:
- COMPLETED: Specific deliverables ("implemented JWT refresh endpoint + rate limiting")
- IN PROGRESS: Current state + next immediate step ("testing password reset flow, need user input on email template")
- BLOCKERS: What's preventing progress
- KEY DECISIONS: Important context or user guidance
```

**After compaction:** `bd show <issue-id>` reconstructs full context from notes field.

### Notes Quality Self-Check

Before checkpointing (especially pre-compaction), verify your notes pass these tests:

‚ùì **Future-me test**: "Could I resume this work in 2 weeks with zero conversation history?"
- [ ] What was completed? (Specific deliverables, not "made progress")
- [ ] What's in progress? (Current state + immediate next step)
- [ ] What's blocked? (Specific blockers with context)
- [ ] What decisions were made? (Why, not just what)

‚ùì **Stranger test**: "Could another developer understand this without asking me?"
- [ ] Technical choices explained (not just stated)
- [ ] Trade-offs documented (why this approach vs alternatives)
- [ ] User input captured (decisions that came from discussion)

**Good note example:**
```
COMPLETED: JWT auth with RS256 (1hr access, 7d refresh tokens)
KEY DECISION: RS256 over HS256 per security review - enables key rotation
IN PROGRESS: Password reset flow - email service working, need rate limiting
BLOCKERS: Waiting on user decision: reset token expiry (15min vs 1hr trade-off)
NEXT: Implement rate limiting (5 attempts/15min) once expiry decided
```

**Bad note example:**
```
Working on auth. Made some progress. More to do.
```

**For complete compaction recovery workflow, read:** [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md#compaction-survival)

## Session Start Protocol

**bd is available when:**
- Project has a `.beads/` directory (project-local database), OR
- `~/.beads/` exists (global fallback database for any directory)

**At session start, always check for bd availability and run ready check.**

### Session Start Checklist

Copy this checklist when starting any session where bd is available:

```
Session Start:
- [ ] Run bd ready --json to see available work
- [ ] Run bd list --status in_progress --json for active work
- [ ] If in_progress exists: bd show <issue-id> to read notes
- [ ] Report context to user: "X items ready: [summary]"
- [ ] If using global ~/.beads, mention this in report
- [ ] If nothing ready: bd blocked --json to check blockers
```

**Pattern**: Always check both `bd ready` AND `bd list --status in_progress`. Read notes field first to understand where previous session left off.

**Report format**:
- "I can see X items ready to work on: [summary]"
- "Issue Y is in_progress. Last session: [summary from notes]. Next: [from notes]. Should I continue with that?"

This establishes immediate shared context about available and active work without requiring user prompting.

**For detailed collaborative handoff process, read:** [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md#session-handoff)

**Note**: bd auto-discovers the database:
- Uses `.beads/*.db` in current project if exists
- Falls back to `~/.beads/default.db` otherwise
- No configuration needed

### When No Work is Ready

If `bd ready` returns empty but issues exist:

```bash
bd blocked --json
```

Report blockers and suggest next steps.

---

## Progress Checkpointing

Update bd notes at these checkpoints (don't wait for session end):

**Critical triggers:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Context running low** - User says "running out of context" / "approaching compaction" / "close to token limit"
- üìä **Token budget > 70%** - Proactively checkpoint when approaching limits
- üéØ **Major milestone reached** - Completed significant piece of work
- üöß **Hit a blocker** - Can't proceed, need to capture what was tried
- üîÑ **Task transition** - Switching issues or about to close this one
- ‚ùì **Before user input** - About to ask decision that might change direction

**Proactive monitoring during session:**
- At 70% token usage: "We're at 70% token usage - good time to checkpoint bd notes?"
- At 85% token usage: "Approaching token limit (85%) - checkpointing current state to bd"
- At 90% token usage: Automatically checkpoint without asking

**Current token usage**: Check `<system-warning>Token usage:` messages to monitor proactively.

**Checkpoint checklist:**

```
Progress Checkpoint:
- [ ] Update notes with COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NEXT format
- [ ] Document KEY DECISIONS or BLOCKERS since last update
- [ ] Mark current status (in_progress/blocked/closed)
- [ ] If discovered new work: create issues with discovered-from
- [ ] Verify notes are self-explanatory for post-compaction resume
```

**Most important**: When user says "running out of context" OR when you see >70% token usage - checkpoint immediately, even if mid-task.

**Test yourself**: "If compaction happened right now, could future-me resume from these notes?"

---

### Database Selection

bd automatically selects the appropriate database:
- **Project-local** (`.beads/` in project): Used for project-specific work
- **Global fallback** (`~/.beads/`): Used when no project-local database exists

**Use case for global database**: Cross-project tracking, personal task management, knowledge work that doesn't belong to a specific project.

**When to use --db flag explicitly:**
- Accessing a specific database outside current directory
- Working with multiple databases (e.g., project database + reference database)
- Example: `bd --db /path/to/reference/terms.db list`

**Database discovery rules:**
- bd looks for `.beads/*.db` in current working directory
- If not found, uses `~/.beads/default.db`
- Shell cwd can reset between commands - use absolute paths with --db when operating on non-local databases

**For complete session start workflows, read:** [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md#session-start)

## Core Operations

All bd commands support `--json` flag for structured output when needed for programmatic parsing.

### Essential Operations

**Check ready work:**
```bash
bd ready
bd ready --json              # For structured output
bd ready --priority 0        # Filter by priority
bd ready --assignee alice    # Filter by assignee
```

**Create new issue:**
```bash
bd create "Fix login bug"
bd create "Add OAuth" -p 0 -t feature
bd create "Write tests" -d "Unit tests for auth module" --assignee alice
bd create "Research caching" --design "Evaluate Redis vs Memcached"
```

**Update issue status:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
bd update issue-123 --priority 0
bd update issue-123 --assignee bob
bd update issue-123 --design "Decided to use Redis for persistence support"
```

**Close completed work:**
```bash
bd close issue-123
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented in PR #42"
bd close issue-1 issue-2 issue-3 --reason "Bulk close related work"
```

**Show issue details:**
```bash
bd show issue-123
bd show issue-123 --json
```

**List issues:**
```bash
bd list
bd list --status open
bd list --priority 0
bd list --type bug
bd list --assignee alice
```

**For complete CLI reference with all flags and examples, read:** [references/CLI_REFERENCE.md](references/CLI_REFERENCE.md)

## Field Usage Reference

Quick guide for when and how to use each bd field:

| Field | Purpose | When to Set | Update Frequency |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **description** | Immutable problem statement | At creation | Never (fixed forever) |
| **design** | Initial approach, architecture, decisions | During planning | Rarely (only if approach changes) |
| **acceptance-criteria** | Concrete deliverables checklist (`- [ ]` syntax) | When design is clear | Mark `- [x]` as items complete |
| **notes** | Session handoff (COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/NEXT) | During work | At session end, major milestones |
| **status** | Workflow state (open‚Üíin_progress‚Üíclosed) | As work progresses | When changing phases |
| **priority** | Urgency level (0=highest, 3=lowest) | At creation | Adjust if priorities shift |

**Key pattern**: Notes field is your "read me first" at session start. See [WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md#session-handoff) for session handoff details.

## Issue Lifecycle Workflow

### 1. Discovery Phase (Proactive Issue Creation)

**During exploration or implementation, proactively file issues for:**
- Bugs or problems discovered
- Potential improvements noticed
- Follow-up work identified
- Technical debt encountered
- Questions requiring research

**Pattern:**
```bash
# When encountering new work during a task:
bd create "Found: auth doesn't handle profile permissions"
bd dep add current-task-id new-issue-id --type discovered-from

# Continue with original task - issue persists for later
```

**Key benefit**: Capture context immediately instead of losing it when conversation ends.

### 2. Execution Phase (Status Maintenance)

**Mark issues in_progress when starting work:**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --status in_progress
```

**Update throughout work:**
```bash
# Add design notes as implementation progresses
bd update issue-123 --design "Using JWT with RS256 algorithm"

# Update acceptance criteria if requirements clarify
bd update issue-123 --acceptance "- JWT validation works\n- Tests pass\n- Error handling returns 401"
```

**Close when complete:**
```bash
bd close issue-123 --reason "Implemented JWT validation with tests passing"
```

**Important**: Closed issues remain in database - they're not deleted, just marked complete for project history.

### 3. Planning Phase (Dependency Graphs)

For complex multi-step work, structure issues with dependencies before starting:

**Create parent epic:**
```bash
bd create "Implement user authentication" -t epic -d "OAuth integration with JWT tokens"
```

**Create subtasks:**
```bash
bd create "Set up OAuth credentials" -t task
bd create "Implement authorization flow" -t task
bd create "Add token refresh" -t task
```

**Link with dependencies:**
```bash
# parent-child for epic structure
bd dep add auth-epic auth-setup --type parent-child
bd dep add auth-epic auth-flow --type parent-child

# blocks for ordering
bd dep add auth-setup auth-flow
```

**For detailed dependency patterns and types, read:** [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Dependency Types Reference

bd supports four dependency types:

1. **blocks** - Hard blocker (issue A blocks issue B from starting)
2. **related** - Soft link (issues are related but not blocking)
3. **parent-child** - Hierarchical (epic/subtask relationship)
4. **discovered-from** - Provenance (issue B discovered while working on A)

**For complete guide on when to use each type with examples and patterns, read:** [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Integration with TodoWrite

**Both tools complement each other at different timescales:**

### Temporal Layering Pattern

**TodoWrite** (short-term working memory - this hour):
- Tactical execution: "Review Section 3", "Expand Q&A answers"
- Marked completed as you go
- Present/future tense ("Review", "Expand", "Create")
- Ephemeral: Disappears when session ends

**Beads** (long-term episodic memory - this week/month):
- Strategic objectives: "Continue work on strategic planning document"
- Key decisions and outcomes in notes field
- Past tense in notes ("COMPLETED", "Discovered", "Blocked by")
- Persistent: Survives compaction and session boundaries

### The Handoff Pattern

1. **Session start**: Read bead ‚Üí Create TodoWrite items for immediate actions
2. **During work**: Mark TodoWrite items completed as you go
3. **Reach milestone**: Update bead notes with outcomes + context
4. **Session end**: TodoWrite disappears, bead survives with enriched notes

**After compaction**: TodoWrite is gone forever, but bead notes reconstruct what happened.

### Example: TodoWrite tracks execution, Beads capture meaning

**TodoWrite:**
```
[completed] Implement login endpoint
[in_progress] Add password hashing with bcrypt
[pending] Create session middleware
```

**Corresponding bead notes:**
```
bd update issue-123 --notes "COMPLETED: Login endpoint with bcrypt password
hashing (12 rounds). KEY DECISION: Using JWT tokens (not sessions) for stateless
auth - simplifies horizontal scaling. IN PROGRESS: Session middleware implementation.
NEXT: Need user input on token expiry time (1hr vs 24hr trade-off)."
```

**Don't duplicate**: TodoWrite tracks execution, Beads captures meaning and context.

**For patterns on transitioning between tools mid-session, read:** [references/BOUNDARIES.md](references/BOUNDARIES.md#integration-patterns)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Knowledge Work Session

**Scenario**: User asks "Help me write a proposal for expanding the analytics platform"

**What you see**:
```bash
$ bd ready
# Returns: bd-42 "Research analytics platform expansion proposal" (in_progress)

$ bd show bd-42
Notes: "COMPLETED: Reviewed current stack (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
IN PROGRESS: Drafting cost-benefit analysis section
NEXT: Need user input on budget constraints before finalizing recommendations"
```

**What you do**:
1. Read notes to understand current state
2. Create TodoWrite for immediate work:
   ```
   - [ ] Draft cost-benefit analysis
   - [ ] Ask user about budget constraints
   - [ ] Finalize recommendations
   ```
3. Work on tasks, mark TodoWrite items completed
4. At milestone, update bd notes:
   ```bash
   bd update bd-42 --notes "COMPLETED: Cost-benefit analysis drafted.
   KEY DECISION: User confirmed $50k budget cap - ruled out enterprise options.
   IN PROGRESS: Finalizing recommendations (Posthog + custom ETL).
   NEXT: Get user review of draft before closing issue."
   ```

**Outcome**: TodoWrite disappears at session end, but bd notes preserve context for next session.

### Pattern 2: Side Quest Handling

During main task, discover a problem:
1. Create issue: `bd create "Found: inventory system needs refactoring"`
2. Link using discovered-from: `bd dep add main-task new-issue --type discovered-from`
3. Assess: blocker or can defer?
4. If blocker: `bd update main-task --status blocked`, work on new issue
5. If deferrable: note in issue, continue main task

### Pattern 3: Multi-Session Project Resume

Starting work after time away:
1. Run `bd ready` to see available work
2. Run `bd blocked` to understand what's stuck
3. Run `bd list --status closed --limit 10` to see recent completions
4. Run `bd show issue-id` on issue to work on
5. Update status and begin work

**For complete workflow walkthroughs with checklists, read:** [references/WORKFLOWS.md](references/WORKFLOWS.md)

## Issue Creation

**Quick guidelines:**
- Ask user first for knowledge work with fuzzy boundaries
- Create directly for clear bugs, technical debt, or discovered work
- Use clear titles, sufficient context in descriptions
- Design field: HOW to build (can change during implementation)
- Acceptance criteria: WHAT success looks like (should remain stable)

### Issue Creation Checklist

Copy when creating new issues:

```
Creating Issue:
- [ ] Title: Clear, specific, action-oriented
- [ ] Description: Problem statement (WHY this matters) - immutable
- [ ] Design: HOW to build (can change during work)
- [ ] Acceptance: WHAT success looks like (stays stable)
- [ ] Priority: 0=critical, 1=high, 2=normal, 3=low
- [ ] Type: bug/feature/task/epic/chore
```

**Self-check for acceptance criteria:**

‚ùì "If I changed the implementation approach, would these criteria still apply?"
- ‚Üí **Yes** = Good criteria (outcome-focused)
- ‚Üí **No** = Move to design field (implementation-focused)

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ Acceptance: "User tokens persist across sessions and refresh automatically"
- ‚ùå Wrong: "Use JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry" (that's design, not acceptance)

**For detailed guidance on when to ask vs create, issue quality, resumability patterns, and design vs acceptance criteria, read:** [references/ISSUE_CREATION.md](references/ISSUE_CREATION.md)

## Alternative Use Cases

bd is primarily for work tracking, but can also serve as queryable database for static reference data (glossaries, terminology) with adaptations.

**For guidance on using bd for reference databases and static data, read:** [references/STATIC_DATA.md](references/STATIC_DATA.md)

## Statistics and Monitoring

**Check project health:**
```bash
bd stats
bd stats --json
```

Returns: total issues, open, in_progress, closed, blocked, ready, avg lead time

**Find blocked work:**
```bash
bd blocked
bd blocked --json
```

Use stats to:
- Report progress to user
- Identify bottlenecks
- Understand project velocity

## Advanced Features

### Issue Types

```bash
bd create "Title" -t task        # Standard work item (default)
bd create "Title" -t bug         # Defect or problem
bd create "Title" -t feature     # New functionality
bd create "Title" -t epic        # Large work with subtasks
bd create "Title" -t chore       # Maintenance or cleanup
```

### Priority Levels

```bash
bd create "Title" -p 0    # Highest priority (critical)
bd create "Title" -p 1    # High priority
bd create "Title" -p 2    # Normal priority (default)
bd create "Title" -p 3    # Low priority
```

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Close multiple issues at once
bd close issue-1 issue-2 issue-3 --reason "Completed in sprint 5"

# Create multiple issues from markdown file
bd create --file issues.md
```

### Dependency Visualization

```bash
# Show full dependency tree for an issue
bd dep tree issue-123

# Check for circular dependencies
bd dep cycles
```

### Built-in Help

```bash
# Quick start guide (comprehensive built-in reference)
bd quickstart

# Command-specific help
bd create --help
bd dep --help
```

## JSON Output

All bd commands support `--json` flag for structured output:

```bash
bd ready --json
bd show issue-123 --json
bd list --status open --json
bd stats --json
```

Use JSON output when you need to parse results programmatically or extract specific fields.

## Troubleshooting

**If bd command not found:**
- Check installation: `bd version`
- Verify PATH includes bd binary location

**If issues seem lost:**
- Use `bd list` to see all issues
- Filter by status: `bd list --status closed`
- Closed issues remain in database permanently

**If bd show can't find issue by name:**
- `bd show` requires issue IDs, not issue titles
- Workaround: `bd list | grep -i "search term"` to find ID first
- Then: `bd show issue-id` with the discovered ID
- For glossaries/reference databases where names matter more than IDs, consider using markdown format alongside the database

**If dependencies seem wrong:**
- Use `bd show issue-id` to see full dependency tree
- Use `bd dep tree issue-id` for visualization
- Dependencies are directional: `bd dep add from-id to-id` means from-id blocks to-id
- See [references/DEPENDENCIES.md](references/DEPENDENCIES.md#common-mistakes)

**If database seems out of sync:**
- bd auto-syncs JSONL after each operation (5s debounce)
- bd auto-imports JSONL when newer than DB (after git pull)
- Manual operations: `bd export`, `bd import`
