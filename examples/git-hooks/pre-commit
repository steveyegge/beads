# bd (beads) pre-commit hook
#
# This hook ensures that any pending bd issue changes are flushed to
# .beads/beads.jsonl before the commit is created, preventing the
# race condition where daemon auto-flush fires after the commit.
#
# When sync-branch is configured in config.yaml, .beads changes are committed
# to a separate branch via worktree, so auto-staging is skipped.
#
# Installation:
#   cp examples/git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or use the install script:
#   examples/git-hooks/install.sh
