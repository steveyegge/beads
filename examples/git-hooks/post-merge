# bd (beads) post-merge hook
#
# This hook syncs the bd database after a git pull or merge:
# 1. Checks if any .beads/*.jsonl file was updated
# 2. Runs 'bd sync --import-only --no-git-history' to import changes
#
# Installation:
#   cp examples/git-hooks/post-merge .git/hooks/post-merge
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
#
# Or use the install script:
#   examples/git-hooks/install.sh

# Skip during rebase - git may run post-merge during rebase operations
# and we must not modify working tree files or the rebase will fail
if [ -d .git/rebase-merge ] || [ -d .git/rebase-apply ]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Check if bd is available
if ! command -v bd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Warning: bd command not found, skipping post-merge sync" >&2
    exit 0
fi

# Check if we're in a bd workspace
if [ ! -d .beads ]; then
    # Not a bd workspace, nothing to do
    exit 0
fi

# Check if any JSONL file exists in .beads/
if ! ls .beads/*.jsonl >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    exit 0
fi

# Run bd sync --import-only --no-git-history to import the updated JSONL
# --no-git-history prevents writes to deletions.jsonl during hook operations
# This is more robust than direct import as it handles all edge cases
# Capture both stdout and stderr to show user what went wrong
if ! output=$(bd sync --import-only --no-git-history 2>&1); then
    echo "Warning: Failed to sync bd changes after merge" >&2

    # Don't fail the merge, just warn

# Run quick health check (silent on success, hints if issues found)
# This catches version mismatches, outdated hooks, etc.
