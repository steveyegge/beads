# GitHub Copilot Integration

How to use beads with GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

## Setup

### Quick Setup

1. Install beads-mcp:
   ```bash
   uv tool install beads-mcp
   ```

2. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "beads": {
         "command": "beads-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For all projects:** Add to VS Code `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "beads": {
         "command": "beads-mcp",
         "args": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Initialize beads:
   ```bash
   bd init --quiet
   ```

4. Reload VS Code

### Verify Setup

Ask Copilot Chat: "What beads issues are ready to work on?"

## Using Natural Language

With MCP configured, interact naturally:

```
You: Create a bug for the login timeout
Copilot: Created bd-42: Login timeout bug

You: What issues are ready?
Copilot: 3 issues ready: bd-42, bd-99, bd-17

You: Close bd-42, it's fixed
Copilot: Closed bd-42
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `beads_ready` | List unblocked issues |
| `beads_create` | Create new issue |
| `beads_show` | Show issue details |
| `beads_update` | Update issue |
| `beads_close` | Close issue |
| `beads_sync` | Sync to git |
| `beads_dep_add` | Add dependency |
| `beads_dep_tree` | Show dependency tree |

## Copilot Instructions

Optionally add `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```markdown
## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context.

Quick reference:
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tools not appearing

1. Check VS Code 1.96+
2. Verify mcp.json syntax is valid JSON
3. Reload VS Code window
4. Check Output panel for MCP errors

### "beads-mcp not found"

```bash
# Check installation
which beads-mcp

# Reinstall if needed
uv tool install beads-mcp --force
```

### No database found

```bash
bd init --quiet
```

## FAQ

### Do I need to clone beads?

**No.** Beads is a system-wide CLI tool. Install once, use everywhere. The `.beads/` directory in your project only contains the issue database.

### What about git hooks?

Git hooks are optional. They auto-sync issues but you can skip them during `bd init` and manually run `bd sync` instead.
